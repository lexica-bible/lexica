# Lexica — CLAUDE.md

## Overview
Lexica is a Flask-based Greek and Hebrew Bible word study app. ABP (Apostolic Bible Polyglot) interlinear is the primary text; KJV is a fully searchable parallel corpus. The design is scholarly but accessible — no prior Greek training required.

## HOW TO TALK TO THE USER — read every session, no exceptions
Plain, concise English — like a colleague, not a textbook. The user is a data-center engineer
(CCNA, Linux, lots of hands-on) — NOT a programmer. Assume infra/CLI/networking fluency (don't
explain basic console steps), but use NO developer jargon. Avoid words like *idempotent,
transaction, schema, query/SELECT, commit, null, boolean, lock/read-lock, upsert, snapshot* —
translate them into plain terms ("running it again just redoes the same work, no harm"; "that
command only reads the database, it never changes it"). Short answers; skip heading-heavy formal
reports unless he asks for depth; skip "want me to walk you through it?" offers — just give the
answer. He has flagged this MORE THAN ONCE — treat it as a hard rule, not a preference. Full
detail + the exact words I've slipped on before: memory `feedback_communication_style`.

## THE BAR — 100% accuracy + completeness — read every session, no exceptions
This is a project of accuracy and specifics. A wrong gloss/lemma/number misinforms a reader who
trusts it and can't check the Greek/Hebrew himself. The bar is NOT negotiable:
- **100% accuracy AND completeness.** Coverage (every word has *a* value) is NOT quality (the value is
  *right*) — prove BOTH before calling anything done. "Good enough", "basically done", "mostly covered"
  are rejected. Measure the gap completely (every row, no sampling), drive it to zero, re-verify.
- **Do NOT ship half-baked work to "get the job done."** If I catch myself writing a hedge — "it can read
  a bit X", "KJV-flavored", "good enough for now", "we can refine later" — STOP. That hedge means it
  isn't validated. Validate the SOURCE'S QUALITY on real samples BEFORE building on it; never ship a
  source I've already doubted and plan to "check after." The check comes before the commit, not after he
  pushes back. (2026-06-22: I shipped the word-card gloss on `kjv_def` after flagging it risky — exactly
  the failure this rule exists to stop.)
- **Never suggest an AI prompt change that REGRESSES the model** (parrots framing, over-asserts, adds
  jargon, blacklists instead of reframing). See memory `project_ai_synthesis_quality` for the patterns.
- **Don't create work that we'll have to come back and fix.** Anything less than correct-and-complete is
  not a shortcut, it's a future bug.
- **If I'm about to propose or ship something less than this:** stop, run `/wrap`, and write a clean
  hand-off prompt for a fresh session instead of limping forward. Full record:
  memory `feedback_accuracy_completeness_bar`.

## VERIFY BEFORE YOU CLAIM — read every session, no exceptions
Every factual claim about the code/data/sources gets CHECKED against the actual source BEFORE I say
it — read the file+line, run the read-only check, look at the real rows. Inferring from one or two
lines and stating it as fact is banned. (2026-06-22: I claimed the ABP word card "shows a dictionary
gloss" — twice — without tracing the display logic; it shows the in-verse English word in the common
case. `relocateGloss` only swaps in the `kjv_def` gloss when the word also has an inflected form line.)
**No clean-sweep claims:** never call something a "clean sweep / sure win / validated / stark improvement"
from a flattering sample — check EVERY item or label it a spot-check with the rest unverified, and probe
STRESS cases (loaded/edge), not easy ones. (2026-06-22 same session: I called TBESG "validated" off
love/spirit/God; χάρις→"grace" — a loaded one-word gloss — broke it. Reporting a source's value ≠
vouching it's right.)
**Self-trigger:** if I make a claim I didn't verify, OR I catch myself having guessed, I STOP, run
`/wrap` immediately, and write clean handoff notes for a fresh session — I do NOT keep going. Full
record: memory `feedback_verify_before_claiming`.

## Instructions for Claude Code
(Account: user is on the Max 20x plan — ample headroom. Bias to being THOROUGH and
CORRECT over conserving tool calls. The notes below are about staying focused and
keeping context sharp, NOT about rationing usage.)
- Target the specific function/section relevant to the task — for focus, not frugality
- app.py and the frontend are now split into modules (app.py → core.py + ai.py +
  views_*.py; the old app.jsx → static/src/*.jsx). Read the relevant module/region, not
  everything — for focus, but read as many as correctness needs
- Read as much as you need to get it right — do not starve a task of context to save calls
- Do not attempt to access bible.db directly
- Make minimal changes — do not refactor unrelated code
- Ask for clarification before making large changes
- Go straight to the relevant function; don't scan the whole codebase out of habit

## Effort mode (Opus 4.8) — on the Max 20x plan, headroom is ample
Pick effort by task TYPE. When in doubt, lean higher — the plan affords it.
- **Routine work** (known edits, data scripts, config tweaks, one-line fixes):
  medium effort is plenty; stay efficient but don't cut corners on correctness.
- **Diagnosis / root-cause / data-integrity work** (a symptom several hops from
  its cause, anything touching the words table or Strong's invariants): HIGH
  effort — read as many spots as the trace needs and reason it through. A wrong
  guess on data is expensive (see the 2026-06-03 strongs_base regression — one
  wrong word hid a 592k-row break).
- When unsure which mode you're in, ask the user, or state your assumption.

## Working style (not hard caps — 20x plan, optimize for correctness)
- Show code before changing it (ALWAYS — every mode, no exceptions)
- WORD-ORDER / Strong's-order / proper-noun-slot swaps: confirm the layout against
  the SOURCE (eSword/ABP) ONLY — NEVER guess "what eSword probably shows." If the
  source isn't in front of you, ask the user to check. Read-only dry-run is the
  source of truth before any --apply. (2026-06-07 Act 19:4 lesson.)
- Prefer focused reads over broad scans — for context quality, not call-rationing
- No artificial tool-call or file-count ceiling; use what the task genuinely needs.
  For diagnosis, that may be many reads — that's expected and fine.
- Still avoid genuinely wasteful moves (re-reading a file you just edited, scanning
  the whole repo when you know the target)

## Important
- bible.db lives on PythonAnywhere only, not locally
- Never query or test against a local database
- All db changes must be made on PythonAnywhere

## Deployment
- Preferred deploy: `bash ~/bible-db/scripts/deploy.sh` — pulls, runs the invariant tests, loads any
  non-canonical books WHOSE FILES THE PULL CHANGED (diffs old..new HEAD, runs only the touched
  loaders — a plain code deploy loads nothing), `pip install`s into the bible-env venv WHEN the pull
  changed `requirements.txt` (2026-06-22; a failed install stops the deploy, bare-`pip` fallback if the
  venv path is missing), and reloads the site ONLY if the tests pass. A loader hiccup warns but never
  blocks the reload, so adding a book just needs a normal deploy.
- Manual fallback: `cd ~/bible-db && git pull && touch /var/www/www_lexica_bible_wsgi.py`
- PA git is set `pull.rebase false`, `merge.autoedit no` (no prompts). The database is NOT in git
  (too large) — managed directly on PA.
- After a `requirements.txt` change: `deploy.sh` now runs the `pip install` itself (see above), so a
  normal deploy covers it. Installing BY HAND (manual deploy): on PA, `workon bible-env` THEN
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` — NO `--user` inside the venv (it's
  `/home/appssanding720/.virtualenvs/bible-env`, Python 3.11; a `--user` install lands in the system
  3.13 dir and is ignored). Then reload.
- **Env vars / secrets live in the WSGI, NOT a `.env`.** `/var/www/www_lexica_bible_wsgi.py` sets them
  with `os.environ['KEY'] = '...'`, and those lines MUST sit ABOVE the app import (module-level reads
  like `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get(...)` run at import). `core.load_dotenv()` doesn't reliably
  find a `.env` under the PA web app — don't rely on one. Edit the WSGI, then reload (touch it). Keys
  set there: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `ESV_API_TOKEN`, `OWNER_EMAIL`, the mail keys
  `SMTP_HOST`/`SMTP_PORT`/`SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASS` + `MAIL_FROM` + `SITE_URL` (+ optional `FCBH_API_KEY`,
  `MAIL_REPLY_TO`). Outbound mail goes through **Resend** (relay `smtp.resend.com:587`, user `resend`,
  pass = a Resend API key, From `noreply@lexica.bible`). The nightly `health_check.py` task can't see the
  WSGI env, so ITS copy of the mail keys + `OWNER_EMAIL` lives in a gitignored `~/bible-db/.env` (the
  script `load_dotenv`s it). Full record + gotchas: memory `project_email_smtp`.
- **Accounts / roles / gated texts** (full records: memories `project_user_roles`, `project_esv_audio`,
  `project_visitor_stats`; setup history in TODO_ARCHIVE):
  - Roles nologin / user / berean / admin — a `role` column in `notes.db users`; gates in `views_notes`
    (`is_admin()`, `is_berean()` = berean-or-admin, `is_logged_in()`). `OWNER_EMAIL` is ALWAYS admin
    (bootstrap, even before the column migrates). user (any sign-in) = AI search (login-gated, costs
    money); berean = ESV + NIV; admin = visitor Stats + the in-app Admin page (sets others' roles).
  - Sign-in is email or Google; Google needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + the `google-auth` package and the
    button just hides if either is missing (a code-only deploy never breaks). `notes.db` is gitignored,
    PA-only.
  - ESV + NIV (berean-gated) each have their own `esv.db` / `niv.db` (gitignored, PA-only;
    `scripts/load_esv.py` / `load_niv.py`; `views_esv.py` / `views_niv.py`).
- **Audio sources:** ESV = Crossway's own API (api.esv.org, `ESV_API_TOKEN` in the WSGI — whole-Bible
  Max McLean; `views_esv._crossway_audio_url` follows the 302 to the signed mp3), with FCBH
  (`FCBH_API_KEY`, NT-only) as fallback. KJV = public-domain audiotreasure.com, no key (voice set
  `KJV_AT`; Job/Song/Philemon/2–3 John/Jude fall back to the music set `KJV_FF`). BSB = public-domain,
  no setup. NIV = no audio source (dead end).

## CI / automation (added 2026-06-07)
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — runs on every push/PR: (1) the invariant tests
  (the `tests/test_*.py` set — strongs-join, build-invariants, folded-fixes, argmap, versification; they build their own in-memory data, no
  bible.db needed), (2) rebuilds `app.js` and FAILS if the committed copy is stale. Repo is public; check
  the Actions tab or query `api.github.com/repos/lexica-bible/lexica/actions/runs`. `gh` CLI is installed on the dev box now (2026-06-22; Claude calls it by full path) — NOT on PA. See memory `project_dependabot_workflow`.
  - **LINE-ENDINGS for the app.js check (cost a CI fail 2026-06-14; the "all CRLF" claim CORRECTED
    same day):** Keep `git config core.autocrlf false` — with `autocrlf=true` (Git-for-Windows default)
    your local `git diff` HIDES CR mismatches, so a wrong `app.js` slips past the hook and CI rejects it
    as stale. The `static/src/*.jsx` files are MIXED, NOT all CRLF: some LF (60-library.jsx, 90-app.jsx,
    30-detail-panel), some CRLF (59a/59b, 10-icons, 59-dayintro). Babel keeps a `/* */` block comment's
    CRLF in `app.js`, so app.js carries 4 CRLF from the CRLF sources — the build reproduces them, so CI
    matches as long as you commit src + app.js together. RULE: match a file's EXISTING endings; do NOT
    flip a whole file (noisy diff + changes app.js's CRLF set). Check real endings with `xxd`/a byte
    count, NOT Git-for-Windows `grep -c $'\r'` or piped `git show` (both falsely reported the LF
    60-library.jsx as CRLF this session). Verify like CI before pushing:
    `git checkout HEAD -- static/src/ && npm run build && git diff --quiet -- static/app.js`.
- **Pre-commit hook** (`scripts/githooks/pre-commit`, wired via `git config core.hooksPath scripts/githooks`)
  — local twin of CI: rebuilds+stages app.js if a `static/src/*.jsx` is staged, then runs the tests and
  blocks the commit on failure. LOCAL DEV MACHINE ONLY — on PA it was unset (`git config --unset
  core.hooksPath`) because PA has no Node. Bypass once with `git commit --no-verify`.
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly; opens PRs for pip/npm/actions updates, now
  GROUPED (one PR per ecosystem: pip minor/patch batched + majors solo, all `@babel/*` together,
  actions batched — 2026-06-22). Not auto-merged. **Claude can't merge/close PRs — the safety
  classifier blocks it even with your OK, so it hands you the `gh pr merge/close` commands to run.**
  A normal `deploy.sh` does the `pip install` after a merge. Full record: memory
  `project_dependabot_workflow`.
- Nightly `health_check.py --email --only-warn` email — LIVE on PA 2026-06-16 (daily PA scheduled task,
  23:53 UTC). `--only-warn` = mails ONLY when a check fails (silent on clean nights). The task's mail keys
  + `OWNER_EMAIL` are in `~/bible-db/.env` (a cron can't read the WSGI env). Memory `project_email_smtp`.

## Frontend build step (added 2026-06-06)
- The SOURCE is `static/src/*.jsx` — per-view files, concatenated (filename order;
  numeric prefixes set it) into ONE compilation unit. `static/app.js` is the COMPILED
  output the browser loads (index.html points at `app.js`). The compiled `app.js` IS
  committed to git; `node_modules/` is git-ignored. (Phase 4, 2026-06-06: the old
  3,461-line `static/app.jsx` monolith was split into `static/src/` — see the file
  headers there for what each holds. Same split spirit as the app.py blueprints.)
- After ANY edit to a `static/src/*.jsx` file you MUST rebuild before committing:
  `npm run build` (runs `scripts/build-frontend.js`: concat src -> Babel -> static/app.js).
  One-time setup: `npm install`. Commit BOTH the .jsx source AND the rebuilt app.js.
- The build runs LOCALLY (Node is on the dev machine, not needed on PA). PA deploy is
  unchanged — it just `git pull`s the already-compiled app.js.
- Why concat-then-compile (not `babel <dir>`): one unit emits Babel's spread helper
  once and reproduces the old single-file output exactly (the src files joined by "\n"
  reconstruct the original app.jsx).
- Why the build step at all: in-browser Babel was recompiling all the JSX on every page
  load (~2.5s render delay; server TTFB was only 96ms). Precompiling + production React
  builds removes that tax. Babel-standalone and dev React were dropped from index.html.
- **`design/` is NOT the app — it's throwaway design-tool mockups (standalone mini React apps).**
  The live frontend is ONLY `static/src/*.jsx` → `static/app.js`. Never audit/edit `design/*.jsx`
  as production; use it only as the visual target. (The design tool kept mistaking its own
  `design/library.jsx` mockup for the real app — see the callout in `design/README.md`.)

## Stack
- Backend: Flask (Python), SQLite
- Frontend: React 18 (production UMD), JSX in static/src/*.jsx precompiled via Babel to
  static/app.js (build step — see "Frontend build step" above), HTML/CSS
- Deployed: PythonAnywhere ($10 Dev tier)
- Version control: GitHub (repo: lexica-bible/lexica)

## SEO / crawlable pages + site icons
The SPA is invisible to search engines, so `views_seo.py` serves plain server-rendered HTML
(templates `templates/seo/`) the crawler can read, all reusing the JSON endpoints' read-only SQL:
- `/read/` (book index) · `/read/<slug>` (book) · `/read/<slug>/<ch>` (ABP) · `/read/<slug>/<ch>/<text>`
  (kjv|bsb|heb) — interlinear chips with ABP brackets/numbers; `/word/<strongs>` (G/H word study);
  `/sitemap.xml` generated (chapters + every Strong's used). **PUBLIC-DOMAIN TEXTS ONLY — never ESV/NIV.**
- The app deep-links INTO these: `/?b=&c=&t=` jumps to a chapter, `/?lex=G####` opens the Lexicon —
  read once on mount in `static/src/90-app.jsx`, then the query is stripped.
- `app.py` serves the root files crawlers fetch (`/favicon.ico`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`, `/robots.txt`);
  `/sitemap.xml` is the seo blueprint's. Icons + `og.png` share card live in `static/`, regenerated by
  `scripts/gen-icons.js` (transient `sharp` dep). seo.* endpoints are rate-limit-exempt.
- Full record: memories `project_seo_pages` + `project_seo_branding`. Google Search Console is set up
  (Domain property, sitemap submitted).

## Database Tables
- `verses` — ABP verse text. `verses.text` is the clean, correctly-ordered English PROSE (what
  the reader's prose mode + SEO pages use). NEVER rebuild a single verse from `words` joined by
  `position` — that's raw Greek order and SCRAMBLES ABP's bracket-reordered English. (2026-06-21
  TSK-panel garble: `/api/verse` and `views_crossref._abp_text` were stitching words by position;
  both now read `verses.text`.) NARROW EXCEPTION — don't let this rule excuse a real data bug: a
  "LORD the"-style flip (a determiner stranded AFTER its noun) is NOT the expected bracket scramble,
  it's a `_split_compounds` BUILD bug — when it fronts the words it spread onto blank Greek slots it
  lines them up in Greek order instead of the source English order. Fixed in the build split step
  (preserve source English order when fronting), so the right order is baked back into `words` and the
  reader needs no change. Find the full set with `scripts/audit_split_flip.py` (read-only). Distinct
  from genuinely bracket-reordered verses, where the rule above still holds.
- `words` — ABP word-level interlinear, Strong's tagged. Columns: english, english_head, strongs, strongs_base, greek_pos, bracket_id, italic, italic_words, smcap_words, is_pn, morph, lemma. The displayed Greek lemma is joined live from `lexicon` via `LEFT JOIN lexicon l ON l.strongs_g = w.strongs_base` (the indexed G-prefixed key added in Phase 1; replaced the old `SUBSTR(strongs_base,2)` join — this is why strongs_base MUST stay G/H-prefixed). `is_pn=1` marks proper nouns (set by import_tipnr.py). `morph`/`lemma` columns added rebuild #6 (~78% populated).
- `abp_surface` — `(verse_id, position, form, translit)` side table of the PRINTED (inflected) Greek per ABP word,
  feeding the word-study side-card "in this verse" line (ABP's source has no Greek surface words). Built read-only
  by `scripts/build_abp_surface.py --bh ~/bible-db/bh_scrape.db` (PA-only data step; DROP+rebuilds only its own
  table, never words/verses). SOURCE = ABP's OWN printed Greek from `bh_scrape.db` `bh_words.greek` (the BibleHub
  ABP scrape) — same text as `words`, so it matches ~91% (Rahlfs/TAGNT was tried first but capped at 75%: ABP-OT
  is Vaticanus-Sixtine vs Rahlfs's eclectic text). `/api/chapter` LEFT-JOINs it only if present (deploy-safe).
  bh's Greek is accent-only (no breathing marks), so `strip_marks` stores a form ONLY when it differs from the
  lemma by ENDING (no echo lines) → 56% of words show a line. Surface translit now FILLED by
  `scripts/build_abp_translit.py` (SBL romanization matching the lexicon headword style; the rough-breathing
  'h' is read from the lemma since bh forms have no breathing; re-run after any position-shifting rebuild).
  Full record: memory `project_bsb_words`.
- `lexicon` — Greek Strong's definitions. Has an indexed `lemma_plain` (accent-stripped/lowercased/
  final-sigma-folded lemma) — the fast EXACT key the Word-study search matches first (`bdb` has it too).
  Built by `scripts/add_lemma_plain.py` (folded into `load_lexicon.py` for the Greek side; re-run the
  script after a bdb reload). Word-study lookup short-circuits on an exact `lemma_plain` hit, only
  falling to the slow substring scan when the typed word isn't a headword. Memory `project_lexicon_search_overmatch`.
- `lsj` — Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek lexicon
- `abp_ext` — extended ABP data
- `dotted_lexicon` — corrected headword for ABP dotted Strong's. A side table in bible.db (built on PA,
  not in git) mapping the full dotted number (`G###.N`) → its OWN lemma + romanization, for the dotted
  numbers that are a genuinely DIFFERENT word from their base (ABP parks its added words at "nearest
  Strong's + a dot", so the base lemma is the alphabetical neighbour — G180.2 ἀκατασκεύαστος vs base
  G180 ἀκατάπαυστος). `chapter_text`/`verse_words` COALESCE it over the base `lexicon` join so the word
  card shows the right word; joined only if present (deploy-safe). Built by `scripts/build_dotted_lexicon.py`,
  audited by `scripts/audit_dotted_lemmas.py`. Full record: memory `project_dotted_strongs_lemma`.
- `pn_binding` / `tipnr_entities` / `tipnr_entity_refs` — the Issue-2 entity-binding tables (PA-only, NOT in
  git; rebuilt by `scripts/build_entity_binding.py --apply`, which writes ONLY these, never words/verses).
  `pn_binding(book,chapter,verse,name,entity_uniq,kind,rule,render,hot,tier)` keyed (book,ch,vs,name) maps a
  PN occurrence → its verse-correct TIPNR entity (render=1 rows only; a floor = no row → Fix A); `tipnr_entities`
  = the entity's own card content (uniq/head/section/gender/area/descr/summary/bases/parents+offspring, kin
  for PERSONS only); `tipnr_entity_refs` = its reference list. Served by `/api/metav/entity` → the `.pnbound`
  card. Re-run `--apply` after a words rebuild (it re-tiers from live metaV each run). Memory
  `project_entity_resolution_rebuild`.
- `word_gloss` — plain-meaning lemma gloss for the word card (`strongs` → `gloss` + `source`). Side table in
  bible.db (built on PA, not in git; ~17.5k rows). Greek = Dodson base + TBESG fill + overrides + dotted-by-
  lemma; Hebrew = TBESH + overrides. Joined via `core.word_gloss_cols()` (ABP) and `core.word_gloss_join()`
  (KJV/BSB chapter endpoints — folds a Hebrew byform in SQL); Hebrew reader does a cross-db lookup (heb.db
  can't join bible.db). All deploy-safe, aliased `AS kjv_def`/returned as `lemma_gloss`. Built by
  `scripts/build_word_gloss.py` (`--summary`/`--apply`). ABP + KJV/BSB/Hebrew cards + the Word study tab
  ALL LIVE (2026-06-23). Full record: memory `project_word_card_gloss`.
- `lexica_def` — the **Lexica dictionary** entry per word: our OWN verse-grounded definition (written from the
  Bible's own usage, not LSJ's classical glosses). Side table in bible.db (built on PA, not in git). One row =
  the frozen fields `sense_headlines`/`senses_block`/`range`/`gloss_notes`/`coverage` + `sense_prov` (per-sense
  LXX-provenance flag, Option B) + `fork` (contested-word
  readings + a Study-graph link) + `verses` + `audit` (citation-gate badge) + `raw` (so a better splitter
  re-splits with NO model call). Built by `scripts/build_lexica_def.py` (frozen `VERSE_PROMPT` → Sonnet → split
  → citation gate → fork → write; `--apply` build / `--resplit --apply` re-split stored raw, free; surgical raw
  typo-fixes via `scripts/fix_lexica_raw.py`, no model call). Served by
  `views_lexica.py` `/api/lexica/<strongs>` → the `LexicaBody` card (20-shared-components, BESIDE `LsjBody`;
  `30-detail-panel.jsx` branches `case "lsj"`). **PUBLIC since 2026-06-25** (`LEXICA_ADMIN_ONLY=False`; serves everyone incl. logged-out — a word with
  no entry 404s → the normal LSJ card, deploy-safe; flip the flag back to re-gate). LIVE on ~18 words: the 6
  pilot (psychē + the 5 contested forks dikaioō/charis-G5484/aionios/sarx/ekklesia) + 12 from full-build BATCH 1. **PILOT SHIPPED 2026-06-25:** the v3
  sub-use-test prompt is promoted into `VERSE_PROMPT` (diff-locked vs the reviewer's frozen V3); the 3
  frame-leakers (dikaioō/charis/aionios) are HAND-PINNED — `pin_core` in `CONTESTED` lifts the neutral fork
  core to `entry.pinned_core`, which LEADS the card while the model's framed senses drop below as "Attested
  uses" (display override in `assemble()`, re-applies via `--resplit`, no model call); psychē/sarx/ekklesia
  gate-ship. **Batch-build safety gate = the agreement reviewer `scripts/lexica_agreement.py`** (read-only,
  PA-only; draws a word N×, per-verse SUPPORT+COMPANY tells a fold from a hole) — it certifies PROMPT stability,
  NOT the written draw (the `--apply` citation gate does that), so a reviewer re-run before a write is OPTIONAL
  once the prompt is diff-locked. **Full-build BATCH 1 DONE 2026-06-25** (12 words, the calibration batch; tiers proved out — 3-tier ship-gate:
  concrete/low-polysemy build-one-draw · mid-polysemy `lexica_agreement --runs 3` · high-polysemy/contested/

  the sarx/ekklesia pattern). θεός = a NARROW John 1:1c anarthrous-predicate fork (the baked "identifies the
  Logos as/being God" verdict line cut from the stored raw via `fix_lexica_raw.py`; qualitative reading credited
  to Harner, NOT Colwell — the Colwell-inversion is what it neutralizes). κύριος = a title-transfer fork bound
  to the OT-YHWH-applied-to-Jesus set ONLY (Rom 10:13/Heb 1:10/Phil 2:9-11/Jude 1:4), core sense uncontested.
  `fix_lexica_raw.py` now accepts an empty `--new` (a text CUT, not just a swap).
  **LXX-provenance note (Option B) LIVE 2026-06-25:** a subordinate "rests on Septuagint (Greek-OT) usage" flag
  on senses grounded ≥80% OT (≥4 OT refs) — `sense_provenance()` derives it from the stored citations (book =
  OT/NT), NO model, recomputed on every build/`--resplit` (`--all` rolls it across the whole batch). Fires only
  on the real calques (ekklesia/aionios/charis/dikaioō/Christos), silent on both-testament words
  (pneuma/theos/kyrios). Threshold set against a real census — `scripts/audit_lxx_provenance.py --preview`. Full
  record: memory `project_lexica_dictionary`.
- **Structural / function-word card** — a NEW word-card entry TYPE (beside the Lexica dictionary + LSJ) for
  words whose meaning resolves OUTSIDE the lexeme (the copula, prepositions, …): instead of a sense list it
  states the word's grammatical FUNCTION + the construction relations it appears in (provenance tag GRAMMAR).
  Hand-authored in `structural.py` (a code dict keyed by BASE Strong's — NO model, NO PA data build; normal
  code deploy), served by `views_lexica.py` `/api/lexica/<strongs>` which resolves a structural base FIRST
  (own gate `STRUCTURAL_ADMIN_ONLY`, currently False = public). **`structural_entry` routes a dotted number
  three ways through ONE gate (invariant — keeps every card seam-free):** a decodable FORM of the base → the
  card + its own parse (εἰμί's ~7,800 conjugates, decoded from the dot); a declared frozen IDIOM (ἀνὰ μέσον
  G303.1, in `_IDIOMS`) → a one-line CONTENT note (`kind:"idiom"`, "Phrase/Idiom" header — its card hero shows
  the `_IDIOMS` phrase + a hand-authored `translit` VERBATIM, never the dotted_lexicon lemma/romanizer that
  mangle a two-word phrase, and the abp_surface "in this verse" line is suppressed; the reader chip + word-study
  search read dotted_lexicon directly so the same phrase is pinned there via `PHRASE_OVERRIDES` in
  build_dotted_lexicon.py — 2026-06-26); ANY other dotted
  child (a different word ABP parked at "nearest Strong's + a dot", e.g. G303.2 "stairs") → None → falls
  through to its own word entry, so a parked number never borrows the card. Card = `StructuralBody`
  (20-shared-components.jsx) with a **glance/full split** (the "Function" tab = the finding + a use-boundary
  pointer; "Full entry" = scope/relations/cross-refs — eimi splits, the shorter prepositions collapse to one
  view); `30-detail-panel.jsx` branches `case "lsj"` on `lexica.kind` ("Grammar"/"Idiom" badge); `.gram-*`
  CSS. LIVE: εἰμί (copula) + 17 prepositions + the ἀνὰ μέσον idiom note + the CONJUNCTION batch (ὅτι/ὡς/εἰ
  typology + ἐάν + 12 connectives, 2026-06-25) + the PARTICLE/NEGATIVE/ARTICLE batch (2026-06-26): ἄν (the
  eimi-analog — one use, the underspecification IS the finding, glance/full); δή/γε; the **οὐ/μή MECHANISM
  CUT** — two lexemes split by fact (οὐ, indicative) vs non-fact (μή — typology, glance flags "lest"), both
  carrying a Matthew 5:17 minimal-pair cross-ref + the compounds οὐδέ/μηδέ/οὔτε/μήτε/οὐχί inheriting + naming
  the base split; the ARTICLE ὁ (definite-marker + substantivizer + the "not English 'the'" underspecification
  finding, glance/full; pronominal ὁ δέ flagged → step b) + **ἵνα** (G2443, 2026-06-26 — purpose; the result/ekbatic debate flagged as a GRAMMATICAL
  (not doctrinal) question, glance/full via the contested-flag; exemplar Mark 3:14, a plain uncontested purpose,
  NOT the hardening verses). **The structural inventory is now COMPLETE.** **STRUCTURAL-WORD CONTEST RULE** (ἵνα
  = the worked example): a structural word with SETTLED grammar but a doctrinally-CONTESTED application at
  specific verses does NOT get a fairness-gate fork — the card stays grammatically honest, and the loaded verses
  point OUT to an argument graph where the contest is mapped (the lexeme is innocent; the passage is contested).
  UNLIKE a content-word fork, where the lexeme's OWN senses fork (dikaioō → salvation_how). ἵνα's pointer is
  DEFERRED — its Isaiah-6 hardening graph isn't built yet (the next Lexica piece; evidence = the Hebrew-imperative
  → LXX passive+μήποτε → Synoptic ἵνα/ὅτι chain, run through the standard argmap + five-check review). Frontend
  tweaks: the underspecified-block label is now authored per card (eimi default
  unchanged); a lone cross-ref no longer triggers the glance/full split (so flat οὐ keeps its Mat 5:17 line
  without a Full tab). **card verse lines are verbatim ABP**
  (a Greek-construction card — ABP is the right source even for a KJV reader). Full record + the locked build

  `bsb_strongs(id, word_id, strongs_id)`. strongs_id fully H/G-prefixed (same invariant as kjv_strongs; locked
  in test_build_invariants.py). `form` = the original word AS PRINTED (inflected Hebrew/Greek) + `form_translit`
  its transliteration (from the Berean tables' "WLC / Nestle Base TR RP WH NE NA SBL" + "Translit" columns,
  added 2026-06-15) — they feed the word-detail side-card "in this verse" line; the chip top line + interlinear
  stay the dictionary lemma. `/api/bsb/chapter` selects them only if present (PRAGMA guard, deploy-safe).
  Built by `scripts/load_bsb_words.py` from the Berean Bible project's Strong's-tagged tables
  (`bereanbible.com/bsb_tables.tsv`, public domain, CC0). Gives BSB chip mode + clickable word study (served by

  one `entries` table (row per topic / graph / name; `json` body + `type` + `status`).
  Served by `views_study.py` (`core.study_db()`); the **Study** tab (`static/src/55-study.jsx`). TOPICS = a
  sectioned browse (collapsible subtopics + a BOOK sub-collapse, alphabetical, comma-flipped display
  titles); GRAPHS = an argument map (admin-only): a shared pool of CLAIMS joined by per-tradition LINKS, each
  claim tagged with provenance (text/lexicon = grounded; tradition/conjecture/inference = not) + each link with
  a strength (solid/contested/weak), stress-tested by `argmap.py` (is the conclusion reachable from grounded
  claims on solid links? else name the load-bearing joint, or flag a gap; a grounded+SOLID objection knocks
  its target out → "overturned"). Drawn as a left→right SVG chart per tradition (auto-laid-out: barycenter
  row-ordering + lines routed through the column GAPS so nothing crosses a box). READ-ONLY in-app — authored via
  `scripts/add_study_graph.py`. (Replaced the old Denominations/Arguments claim editors 2026-06-18; full record
  + the graph json shape in memory `project_study_modules`.) Topics open READ-first (Edit button, admin); a
  "Preview as reader" admin toggle skins the tab as a visitor sees it.
  Verse text = ABP prose (KJV fallback).
  **GATING (go-live 2026-06-16): READING is split — published TOPICS + the metaV NAME-topics are PUBLIC
  (no login); argument graphs, all DRAFTS, and every WRITE/editor route stay admin-only; private
  `notes` are stripped from anything served to a reader.** Two-way study↔reader links: a study's verse
  references are clickable (jump into the reader — the resolver returns book/chapter/verse), and tapping a
  verse number shows an "In studies:" line in the xref panel (`/api/study/for-verse/<book>/<ch>/<v>`, a
  cached verse→topics index that includes HAND-AUTHORED studies only — `source != 'metav'`, so the giant
  Nave's imports don't blanket the text). PERF: a whole entry resolves in one batched pass (`_resolve_map`)
  + an in-memory `_RESOLVED_CACHE` (a 1000-verse topic opened ~13s→~1s). The editor's verse lookup is
  **`POST /api/study/verse`** (a query param was silently dropped before the app) and normalizes a typed
  ref to its full book name (`_canonical_ref`: gen 1:1 → Genesis 1:1). Topic INTROS are AI-written,
  text-first Berean (`✦ Draft with AI` button uses the WSGI key; `_draft_intro`/`_INTRO_SYSTEM`).

## Key Design Decisions
- ABP is the primary text — all word study anchored in ABP interlinear
- KJV is a full parallel corpus — searchable, with its own strongs, word clicks, and sidebar
- Italic words in KJV (italic=1) are translator additions with no source word
- Strong's G-numbers → lexicon/lsj tables; H-numbers → bdb table
- No systematic theology imported — text speaks first (Berean approach)
- PLAIN MEANING, NOT TRADITION (hard rule): glosses/word-meanings = the plain, attested sense, NEVER the
  theologically-loaded or equivocated English (χάρις = "favor/kindness", NOT "grace"; πνεῦμα = "spirit/
  breath", NOT "Ghost"). Give the RANGE when a word has one; a single church-word gloss is a red flag.
  Applies to the word card, AI synthesis, lexicon, studies. Memory `feedback_plain_meaning_not_tradition`.
- Function words (171-word set) are filtered from search results
- Two-ending Greek adjectives (masculine & feminine share one form) show "Masculine/Feminine" on the
  word-study card when the morph source never resolves them — `decodeMorph` (00-core.jsx) checks the
  `TWO_END_SOFT_OT/_NT` sets in `static/src/00b-two-ending.jsx`, generated by `scripts/build_two_ending.py`
  (re-run after a words rebuild). Feminine/Neuter tags + words the source does resolve are left alone.
  Memory `project_two_ending_gender`.

## strongs_base format — CRITICAL INVARIANT
- `words.strongs_base` is fully G/H prefixed ('G4151', 'H7307') — normalized 2026-06-01
- This is NOT cosmetic: the lexicon join matches `l.strongs_g = w.strongs_base` (strongs_g =
  'G'||strongs). A BARE strongs_base ('4151') won't equal 'G4151' → NULL lemma (missing, not
  wrong). Under the OLD `SUBSTR(strongs_base,2)` join it was worse — a bare base shaved a DIGIT →
  WRONG lemma. (2026-06-03, pre-Phase-1: a rebuild left 592k bare → G2206 ζηλόω rendered as
  ἄκρον/G206. Fixed by `UPDATE words SET strongs_base='G'||strongs_base WHERE strongs_base GLOB
  '[0-9]*'`.) tests/test_strongs_join.py + test_build_invariants.py lock this invariant.
- `words.strongs` (the other column) is intentionally LEFT BARE ('2206', dotted '2321.1');
  the frontend renders it as `G{strongs}`. Only strongs_base carries the prefix.
- DOTTED-NUMBER CAVEAT: strongs_base drops the `.N` (built as `st.split(".")[0]`), so a dotted ABP number
  that's a DIFFERENT word than its base resolves the base's lemma through the join. The `dotted_lexicon`
  side table + a COALESCE in the word card correct this (see that table + memory `project_dotted_strongs_lemma`);
  form-variants like 1510.x (forms of εἰμί) correctly keep the base lemma.
- `kjv_strongs.strongs_id` is also fully prefixed (was always so)
- Always use single-match in SQL: WHERE w.strongs_base = 'G4151'
- After ANY words-table rebuild, verify: `SELECT count(*) FROM words WHERE strongs_base GLOB '[0-9]*'` must be 0
- AI system prompt may still reference old triple-match — update if issues arise

## Book Abbreviations
- ABP verses table uses: Mar (Mark), Joh (John), Php (Philippians), Jas (James), Heb (Hebrews)
- NT_BOOKS, BOOK_ORDER, BOOK_LABELS in static/src/00-core.jsx all use these abbreviations
- _KJV_BOOK_ID in app.py matches the same set

## Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop ≥1100px**: navy header, left nav panel (224px), lib-bar toolbar, detail panel as right sidebar
- **Mobile <1100px**: no header, sticky mobile toolbar (lib-toolbar), bottom tab nav, panels as bottom sheets
- JS thresholds: `navVisible >= 1100`, `isMobile < 1100`, `desktopBar` removed (two states only)
- CSS: `@media (max-width: 1099px)` / `@media (min-width: 1100px)` — no other breakpoints except 520px for very small phones

## Library Tab
Full per-feature history lives in memory (each block names its file). This keeps the standing
rules + gotchas; open the named memory for the backstory.

**Layout**
- Desktop toolbar (lib-bar): `[‹ Ch ›] | [Compare ▾] | [Strong's] [Interlinear] | [Chip] [Prose]`.
  Text source lives in the LEFT NAV, not the toolbar. ABP/BSB/HEB are one-click (HEB grays on NT —
  OT-only; falls back to KJV in the slot if heb.db is absent); KJV/ESV/NIV + non-canon books fold
  into a **"More ▾"** floating popout. (KJV was demoted into "More" 2026-06-22 — BSB is the default
  English now; the `kjvInMore = hebShown` flag keeps KJV up top only when heb.db can't fill the slot.
  Memory `project_hebrew_source_swap`.) The source row + Eras/Days are **underline tabs**, NOT boxed
  segments — the source row is a 4-equal-column grid (`.nav-source-seg.seg`) so a long "More" label
  can't shove the others.
- Mobile cockpit (lib-toolbar, fixed at the BOTTOM/thumb-zone on the Library tab) is an
  ICON row of five EQUAL-width slots (2026-06-20): `[🔍 Search] [▷ Play] [Abbr Ch] [ⓘ Info] [⚙ Options]`.
  Center slot keeps TEXT but shows the 3-letter book abbreviation (`selBook.abbrev`, "Amo 1"), not the
  full name; right slot is the sliders `Icon.Modes` (opens the reading-options sheet), not ABP/KJV text.
  Audio scrubber docks above the cockpit (`.lib-audio-dock`); desktop chrono keeps the inline one.
- Compare ▾, the "More" popout, and the Aa size/theme menu all close on outside-click/Esc AND
  **swallow that dismiss click** (capture-phase one-shot) so it doesn't hit a word chip behind them.

**Text sources / HEB**
- HEB = public Hebrew OT interlinear (memory `project_hebrew_ot_interlinear`): OT books only (book
  list + mobile picker drop NT in HEB mode), NO chronological order (Chronological is grayed in
  Hebrew). On a non-Hebrew text sitting on a NT book the HEB selector is grayed, not hidden.
- **Gray-vs-hide is the user's per-control call** (memory `feedback_gray_dont_hide`): GRAY a real
  feature that doesn't apply here (HEB on NT, Search on ESV/NIV, the MOBILE reading toolbar's play
  button when a text has no audio — kept grayed so the row stays balanced + book/chapter centered,
  2026-06-16); HIDE Compare + the order toggle on non-canon, and ESV/NIV (copyright). Propose gray for
  inactive-but-applicable, but confirm per control.

**Reader appearance** (memory `project_reader_appearance`)
- Reader font = `--f-serif` (Source Serif 4). The `Aa ▾` menu / mobile ModesSheet hold A−/A+ size +
  the **Light · Sepia · Dark** theme toggle. A font PICKER was tried and reverted — don't re-add one.
- Verse number + per-word Strong's SCALE with the A−/A+ size (`.lib-vnum` ≈0.5×, `.lib-iw-strongs`
  ≈0.53× of `--lib-font-size`) — keep relative, don't pin to fixed px.
- Themes ride `data-theme` on `<html>` (`lexica.theme.v1`); colors are vars at the TOP of styles.css.
  **Add new buttons with `--ctl-bg`/`--ctl-on`, never hardcoded `#fff`.** Dark traps: an
  `--ink`/`--accent` background flips LIGHT in dark, so pair its text with `var(--paper)`; borders use
  `var(--rule)` not `var(--line)`; navy header stays navy in every theme.
- **Palette tokens (reset 2026-06-19 to the Claude Design spec — implement his calls, don't freelance
  hues):** `--accent` = STEEL-BLUE (oklch 240, primary links/active), `--ai` = VIOLET (280, AI features),
  `--hl-match` = `#f0d27a` (the ONE shared gold for a matched/target word — used by `.corpus-hit` +
  `.lib-search-mark`, fixed across themes). **Gold (`--gold`) is RESERVED for target words ONLY** — active
  tabs, count pills, etc. use `--accent`. Navy = brand header + the chronological "you are here" active-passage
  rule (one shared `.nav-passage.on/.plan-passage.on/.mpick-passage.on`, dark falls back to `--spine-nt`; see
  memory `project_chronological_tab`). Memory `project_ai_search_redesign`.
- Desktop scrollbars slim app-wide + `html { scrollbar-gutter: stable }` reserves the gutter so
  swapping ABP↔KJV never shifts layout. Fonts load **`display=optional`, NOT `swap`**
  (templates/index.html) — kills the mobile toolbar reload flash. Don't switch back.

**Render modes**
- Chip = every word clickable, interlinear stack (Greek → English → Strong's). Prose = plain inline,
  only verse numbers tappable. KJV locks Prose to English. English-only non-canon books: the Chip
  toggle gives a verse-per-line layout (`renderExtraLines`); Strong's/Interlinear stay locked.
- **Hebrew "Prose" = the same interlinear chips flipped LEFT-TO-RIGHT** (2026-06-22): the Prose button
  (was grayed in Hebrew) toggles `viewMode` and a `.lib-heb-ltr` class that sets the row/content
  `direction:ltr` — only the WORD order flips; each `.lib-iw-heb` keeps its own `direction:rtl` so the
  letters stay correct. Strong's/Interlinear still work in it. Flag `hebProse = hebMode && viewMode==="prose"`
  in BOTH 60-library.jsx (desktop lib-bar + render) and 59b-library-nav.jsx (mobile ModesSheet). Matches the
  Ask-corpus Hebrew layout. Memory `project_hebrew_ot_interlinear`.
- **Chip-vs-prose for verses shown OUTSIDE the reader** (memory `project_lexicon_tab`): CHIP (ABP
  brackets + punctuation outside `]`) = reading pane + side-card interlinear. PROSE (plain, no
  brackets) = TSK xref, Study verses, side-card quote, in-text find list, AND Search + Lexicon result
  lists. Don't bracket the prose surfaces.
- **ABP brackets render INLINE in the reader's chips** (memory `project_library_bracket`): `[`/`]`
  ride inside the word's english cell (`.lib-iw-brk`), NOT a separate column. Old `.lib-bracket*`
  column CSS is dead.
- Italic = translator additions, muted/italic: KJV (italic=1), ABP (words.italic=1), ABP `[word]`.

**Compare** (memory `project_pericopes_parallel`)
- Pick 2–4 of ABP/KJV/BSB/ESV/NIV side by side (`translation === "parallel"`, `compareSel` = which).
  Desktop = N columns; mobile = stacked, one labeled line per text. Notes/highlights shared across
  columns (whole-verse paint).
- Labels are **navy, not gold**. Mobile per-line label runs INLINE with the verse — the chip box MUST
  be plain `inline`, NOT `inline-flex` (inline-flex drops a wrapping verse below the label). Chip mode
  IS allowed in compare (only place ABP Greek shows beside translations).
- Desktop picker = checkbox dropdown on Compare. Mobile = the Reading sheet's Text picker: TAP = read
  one, LONG-PRESS = tick into the 2–4 compare set.

**Chronological / reading plan** (memory `project_chronological_tab`)
- Reading-order toggle Canonical|Chronological, any version. Static `chronological.json` (no DB). An
  `Eras | Days` toggle sits atop the chrono picker.
- Days = a 365-day plan with per-text progress (`lexica.plan.v1`), binned into ~12 collapsible Month
  blocks. Component `static/src/58-dayplan.jsx`.
- Chrono mode shows an ESV-style daily Reading-intro panel (AI title+summary + era timeline):
  `views_chrono.py` + `static/src/59-dayintro.jsx`. **NO brown** anywhere — markers/hovers use
  `--accent`, not `--gold` (memory `feedback_no_brown`).

**Navigation / jumps**
- Left-nav book list is an ACCORDION (memory `project_book_nav_polish`): click a book to open its
  chapters, click again to collapse; testament spine + per-book chapter counts. Hover/active pills use
  `color-mix(... var(--bg) ...)`, NOT `--bg-sunk` (invisible on sepia). Mobile `Book Ch ▾` opens to
  the BOOK list first.
- Jumping to a verse (search/lexicon/read-in-context/xref/note) lands it in the UPPER THIRD; the left
  nav scrolls the active book to the TOP of its own list, never the window. The verse-number click
  target is an inner `.lib-vnum-num` hugging the digits (the empty gutter is inert).
- **Chrono jump rule:** an EXTERNAL jump (Search/Lexicon/Notes — flagged `nav.extern`) drops the
  reader back to canonical; an IN-READER jump (verse-number xref, word panel, chasing an xref) STAYS
  chronological (moves `chronoPos` to the passage). Either way `chronoPos` survives.
- Clicking a verse number opens the TSK Cross-Reference panel. Desktop link-over from Search/Lexicon
  auto-opens that verse's xref card over the chapter summary (tucked under any open word/note card).

**Detail rail** (memories `project_side_panel_rail`, `project_detail_panel_interlinear`,
`project_bsb_words`)
- Word clicks → LSJ (G-numbers), BDB (H-numbers), or metaV (proper nouns); KJV/Hebrew route the same.
- The side panel's Interlinear toggle FOLLOWS the reading text (KJV/BSB/Hebrew/ABP endpoints);
  Greek/Hebrew leads, English muted. ABP brackets inline.
- Headword = the dictionary lemma (big) + its dictionary gloss; the word's *in-this-verse* English
  now sits DOWN on the inflected "in this verse" form line (Hebrew/BSB/ABP; ABP form via `abp_surface`;
  KJV has none). **Lemma gloss = the `word_gloss` side table** (scripts/build_word_gloss.py; on PA, not in
  git), which REPLACED the KJV-ized `lexicon.kjv_def` ("charity"/"Ghost"). Greek = Dodson's plain ranges +
  TBESG fill for LXX-extended + a few plain-meaning overrides (χάρις→"favor, kindness", πνεῦμα→"spirit,
  breath"); Hebrew = TBESH + overrides (sheol→"grave, realm of the dead", olam→"age, long duration");
  ABP dotted glossed by their OWN lemma. **All word cards + the Word study tab are LIVE (2026-06-23)** — ABP
  via `core.word_gloss_cols()`; KJV/BSB chapter
  endpoints use `core.word_gloss_join()`, Hebrew does a cross-db lookup, and the card shows the plain meaning
  up top for EVERY word with a gloss that isn't a name/place (`showLemmaGloss` in 30-detail-panel.jsx) — words
  with an "in this verse" form line drop the contextual english onto it, no-form words (KJV, ABP-no-form) let
  the meaning replace the in-verse word up top.
  Plain-meaning rule: "Key Design Decisions" + memory `feedback_plain_meaning_not_tradition`. Full state:
  memory `project_word_card_gloss`.
- Rail stacks ≤3 deep: summary/Intro → xref → (word OR note). The "‹ back" link NAMES the card
  beneath it; the note card keeps just an X (DESKTOP). Word/xref panels trigger `has-detail` → compacts
  `.lib-reading` on desktop.
- **Mobile = bottom sheets, unified 2026-06-19:** every rail panel + word-study/notes/reading sheet
  shares ONE slide-up animation + scrim + radius/shadow and closes by **swipe-down + tap-scrim — NO close
  X on mobile** (X stays on DESKTOP panels; real centered modals like Account/password keep theirs).
  Section spacing aligns to the LOCKED word card. `useSwipeToDismiss`, memory `project_mobile_gestures`.
  Heights still drift (not yet unified — see that memory).

**Other**
- Focus mode (memory `project_focus_mode`): tap blank to enter, Esc/tap exits. Mobile hides chrome.
  **Desktop (rebuilt 2026-06-19): a dark + blurred wash makes the chrome RECEDE and go NON-interactive
  (click the wash to exit); the centered "book page" is READ-ONLY — any tap exits, word/verse clicks are
  off (those panels sit behind the wash). Light shadow, plain ‹ › chevrons (circles were tried + reverted).**
  Not remembered.
- In-text search (magnifying-glass panel, memory `project_esword_reference`): searches the current
  text; modes Any/All/Phrase; range presets + whole-word/case/exclude; `/api/text-search`. **Gotcha:**
  ABP's `verses.book` is a TEXT abbreviation, so a plain sort is alphabetical — `_ABP_RANK_SQL` maps
  each abbrev to Bible order so ABP sorts/filters canonically.
- Library remembers your spot across reloads (memory `project_refresh_persistence`): the `lexica.*`
  keys restore book/chapter/translation/order/compare/theme/font. **Lesson: restore instant toggles
  synchronously in the `useState` initializer, not an async effect — else the default flashes before
  the saved value.** Wheel over fixed chrome (header/nav/toolbar/rail) doesn't scroll the reading pane.

## Notes, Highlights, Bookmarks + Accounts (study notes — LIVE 2026-06-09)
Full detail: memory `project_notes_highlights`. The headline facts:
- **Sign-in lives in the DESKTOP header:** right side of the navy header — a "Log in" pill (opens the
  `AuthModal`, `authOpen` in 90-app.jsx) when signed out, or your **display name (else email)** when signed
  in. Clicking it opens the **account panel as a dropdown anchored under the button on the current page**
  (`AccountModal anchored`, `accountOpen` in 90-app.jsx) — it no longer jumps to the Notes tab (2026-06-20).
  The signed-in label is PLAIN TEXT now (the old pill/chip was dropped). `Header` props
  `email`/`name`/`onLogin`/`onAccount`. **Mobile has NO header**, so account there stays in the Notes tab;
  the in-tab account row is HIDDEN on desktop (redundant with the header).
- **Browser-local first; accounts are OPT-IN.** Notes live in the browser (`localStorage`
  `lexica.notes.v1`) and the app is fully usable with NO account. Signing in (below) syncs them
  across devices. One record = a word-position anchor + optional text + optional color + optional
  bookmark flag — a note, highlight, and bookmark are the SAME record:
  `{id, device, corpus, translation, book, bookName, chapter, start:{verse,pos}, end:{verse,pos},
  snippet, body, color, bookmark, deleted, created, updated}`. `id` minted AT CREATION. Delete is a
  SOFT delete (`deleted:true` tombstone) so deletes propagate through sync/import.
- **Accounts / sync — `notes.db`, the FIRST + ONLY visitor-write path on the site.** Kept OUT of
  bible.db (corpus is rebuilt; user data must survive). `core.notes_db()`; tables `users`, `tokens`,
  `notes` (one row per note, keyed by `code = "u<user_id>"`). `users` carries an optional `name`
  column (display name, auto-added on startup; shown instead of the email when set). `views_notes.py`
  blueprint: `/api/auth/signup|login|logout|me|config|google|set-name|delete-account` + `/api/notes/sync`
  (Bearer token). `set-name` saves/clears the display name; `delete-account` permanently removes the
  user + all their notes/plan/tokens (the in-app confirm makes you type "delete"). Passwords
  one-way hashed (werkzeug, ships with Flask). Stay-logged-in = random bearer token in `tokens` +
  browser `localStorage` `lexica.auth.v1`; logout deletes it. Sync = two-way last-write-wins by id.
  Guards: rate limits, size/count caps, parameterized SQL. Tables auto-create (deploy is a normal pull).
  Password **reset** + **set-password** (so a Google-only account can add one) are LIVE 2026-06-16 via
  SMTP/Resend — `request-reset`/`reset`/`set-password` in views_notes + a `password_resets` table; the
  emailed link opens the SPA at `/?reset=<token>`. `request-reset` always returns ok (never reveals
  whether an email has an account); `reset` is single-use + 1h + clears every existing session. NO email
  *verification* on signup yet. Mail setup + the 535/550 gotchas: memory `project_email_smtp`.
- **Google sign-in (optional).** `/api/auth/google` verifies Google's signed token (`google-auth`)
  and finds-or-creates the account by email. Shows only when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set AND
  `google-auth` is importable — both checked LAZILY in `_google_ready()` so a deploy before setup
  can't break the site (button just stays hidden). See Deployment for the PA setup (it's done + live).
- Gestures (do NOT fight word-click=lexicon / verse-number=TSK): drag-select text → bar with 5 color
  swatches + "Note"; right-click (desktop) / long-press (mobile) a verse number → menu
  (Bookmark · Note · 5 colors). Mobile "Add note" bar pins to screen bottom (clear of the OS
  copy/share toolbar); `selectionchange` backstop. Inline bookmark marker at the start of any verse
  with a record (indents first line only).
- Anchoring is PER READING TEXT and covers non-canon texts too. ABP AND BSB (2026-06-15) capture exact
  word-spots (`data-note-pos` on the chip spans, `data-note-verse` on rows); KJV still anchors at the
  whole verse. Square corners + flush chips make a multi-word highlight one continuous bar. Same-anchor
  reuse (no dupes) via `NotesStore.findAnchor`.
- **Highlights paint across ALL translations (verse-level), 2026-06-09.** A highlight shows in ABP,
  KJV, and BSB alike — `chapterNotes` (`forChapter`) gathers every translation's records for the
  book+chapter; `hiForWord` paints EXACT words only in the text it was made in (`n.translation ===
  translation`) and ROUNDS UP to the whole verse in any other translation (words don't line up
  cross-text). The old same-`translation`-only wall is gone. ABP and BSB paint per-WORD inside their own
  text (BSB since 2026-06-15, via bsb_words positions); KJV still paints whole-verse only — KJV word-level
  is the one remaining open piece (kjv_words has positions, so the BSB `renderBsbVerse` pattern could close it).
- **Journal — free-form second note mode (LIVE 2026-06-09).** "Verse notes | Journal" toggle in the
  Notes tab. A journal page is the SAME record shape with `kind:"journal"` + `title` + `body` and NO
  anchor (no `.start`) — plain text, autosaving full-page editor, rides the same store/sync/Export-
  Import. Store: `journals()`, `createJournal()`, `getActiveJournal()`/`setActiveJournal()` (the page
  you last opened, in `localStorage` `lexica.journal.active.v1`), `appendToJournal()`. The merge guard
  lets `kind:"journal"` through without an anchor; `all()` keeps journals OUT of the verse-note list.
  Server per-page cap is bigger for journals (`_MAX_JOURNAL_BYTES` 64KB vs notes' 8KB).
- **Copy + send-verse-to-journal from the reader.** The drag-select bar AND the verse-number menu both
  carry Copy (verse text to clipboard) + Journal (appends `Genesis 1:8 (ABP) — text` — full book name +
  the reading text tagged; parallel reads `ABP/KJV`, non-canon gets no tag — via `journalLine()` in
  60-library.jsx, to the OPEN journal page; if none is open it flashes "Open a journal page first").
  A small `lib-flash` toast confirms. Both menus share ONE left-to-right order — colors · Note · Journal ·
  Copy (· Bookmark on the verse menu only) — keep them aligned if you touch either.
- Files: `static/src/12-notes-store.jsx` (`NotesStore` + sync/auth + journal helpers + `NOTE_COLORS`/
  `NOTE_COLOR_CSS` + `useNotesVersion`), `static/src/35-notes.jsx` (`NoteAddPopover`, `VerseNoteMenu`,
  `NoteColorRow`, `NotesPanel` editor, `JournalView`/`JournalEditor`, `NotesView` tab, `AuthModal`).
  Wiring in `60-library.jsx` (selection, paint, markers, verse menu, copy/journal, `flash`) + `90-app.jsx`
  (`activeNote` + panel + Notes tab). Notes tab: text search + filters (All/Bookmarks/Highlights/Notes)
  + sort (Recent/Reference) + collapsible group-by-book + the Journal toggle. **Top decluttered
  2026-06-11: the account email + Log out (or Log in / Sign up) sit in the title row — no "Signed in:"
  label, no Sync-now button, and the Export/Import buttons were dropped from the UI** (the
  store/sync code stays; account sync covers cross-device). **Mobile gotcha (fixed 2026-06-11): the
  base `.seg`/`.seg-b` pill styling was defined ONLY in the `≥1100px` desktop block, so any `.seg`
  control outside the Library on a phone (Notes mode/filter/sort, the owner About|Stats toggle)
  rendered as plain run-on text — a mirror rule now lives in the `≤1099px` block.** The mobile
  reading-options sheet (ModesSheet) shows Order + Study-layer as text labels (chip/prose + font
  stay icons).

## TSK Cross-Reference Panel
- Endpoint: GET /api/cross-references/curated/<book>/<chapter>/<verse>
- Step 1: Haiku selects 8-10 strongest refs from the full TSK list, reading the candidates + the
  source verse in BSB (KJV fallback — clearer than "thou/thee" for judging links; 2026-06-22,
  `cand_texts`). The picker returns indices into `all_refs`, so the cross_references KJV verse-id
  join is untouched.
- Step 2: Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-6) writes the synthesis — adaptive length (~100-word soft
  ceiling, runs longer for a rich link), anchored in ABP source vocabulary. Prompt carries a
  worked example. (Moved off Haiku 2026-06-09 — ONLY the synthesis is Sonnet; the Step-1 picker
  and every other AI feature stay on Haiku.) BOTH the source verse AND the curated cross-refs are
  fed to it in ABP (2026-06-17, `_abp_text` in views_crossref.py); the fallback when ABP's
  versification lacks a verse is now **BSB, then KJV** (2026-06-22, `_bsb_text`) — so the write-up
  never quotes KJV "thou/thee". The displayed verse field is **`text`** (BSB-or-KJV; renamed from
  `kjv_text` 2026-06-22, frontend 40-crossref-panel.jsx). A `msg:` salt in `_XREF_VER` (now
  `bsb-fallback-4`) is bumped on any message/payload change so cached rows refresh (the fingerprint
  covers the prompts, not the message text or payload shape).
- Cached in ai_search_cache, key prefix `xref_cur:`/`xref_synth:`, ver_key=`xref:<hash>`
  (fingerprint of the two xref prompts — see "AI result cache" below)

## Lexicon Tab
- **REDESIGNED 2026-06-19 (under development) — see memory `project_ai_search_redesign`.** "Word study"
  is now a 3-pane layout (distribution rail · occurrences · word card) in `static/src/80-lexicon.jsx`;
  AI search was split OUT into its own **"Ask the corpus"** tab (`static/src/52-ask-corpus.jsx`, view
  key `corpus`) — it no longer renders inside Word study. New `--ai` steel-blue theme token = the AI
  accent. `/api/lexicon/profile` now also returns `derivation` + `related` (cognates, on-the-fly from the
  lexicon `derivation` text). The data flow + endpoints below are unchanged; the UI is still in flux
  (visual-fidelity + AI-curation passes pending). The two sections below describe the data model, not the
  current layout.
- **2026-06-19c — mobile word study built + the word card unified:** desktop + mobile share
  `renderDistRows`/`renderSenses`/`renderWordCardInner`; the English "words rendered" list is a
  collapsible `.glsenses`/`.glrow` card pinned above the occurrences. **Mobile (<1100px)** branches
  `if (isMobile)` before the desktop `.ws` return: context strip (`.wm-ctx`) → reading area (`.wm-main`)
  → icon-only bottom tools bar (`.wm-tabs`). The top section-nav is ICON-ONLY now too. **One shared height
  `--bar-h` (48px, in :root) sizes EVERY mobile chrome bar** (top nav, Library cockpit `.lib-toolbar`,
  `.wm-tabs`) + the sheet clearances — bars/sheets use `100dvh` + safe-area, never `100vh`. The **word CARD
  reuses the Library detail card's shared classes** (`.detail-hero`/`.sec`/`.detail-head`/
  `.detail-strong-head`/`.detail-body`/`.occ-link`) so the two can't drift — **word-study-only tweaks MUST
  be scoped to `.wd`; NEVER edit the shared rule (it leaks into the Library word card, which the user has
  LOCKED).** Mobile sheets (`WsSheet`) use the shared `useSwipeToDismiss` hook (`.wm-sheet` reserves
  `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`); `.occ-link` action links are steel-blue `--ai`; results filters are
  underline `.tg` tabs. Full record: memory `project_ai_search_redesign`.
- **2026-06-20 — desktop Word study mirrors the Library shell.** The right word card is a fixed full-height
  panel over the navy header (like the Library's `.detail-side`): card head = header height so the divider
  runs unbroken across (empty state too, via `.wd .empty-pane::before`), columns match the Library (224px
  rail / `--sidebar-w` card), Strong's-number size back to the shared 18px, and the account pill is shifted
  clear with `.app.view-lexicon .hdr-right`. Distribution rail: `.brail-top` height = the search box so the
  two divider lines align; "All books" lost its box. The per-book bar's scaling is a DEAD END (46px track too
  narrow to read any curve change — left at the original linear). Memory `project_ai_search_redesign`.
- Dedicated word study tab — separate from AI Search
- Flow: search box → word profile → gloss chips → book distribution → verse list
- Smart search: detects Strong's (G4151, H7307), Greek, Hebrew, English
- Endpoints: `/api/lexicon/lookup`, `/api/lexicon/profile/<strongs>`, `/api/lexicon/verses/<strongs>/<book>`
- `lexicon_verses` response: `{verses: [{chapter, verse, words: [{w, h, i?}]}], glosses: [{gloss, count}]}`
  - `h=true` marks the target word in each verse (rendered highlighted in gold)
  - `glosses` = per-book rendering breakdown (chips update when a book is selected)
  - Optional `?gloss=spirit` param filters verse list to a specific rendering
  - **`<book>` accepts `all`** (2026-06-24): the default "All books" view lists EVERY occurrence
    across the Bible in canonical order (was a "pick a book" prompt). `_all_books_verses()` in
    views_lexicon.py serves it for all four sources, returns lightweight verse keys each tagged with
    its `book` (the lazy `VerseRow` re-fetches text), honors `?testament=ot|nt`, and caps at
    `_ALL_VERSES_CAP` (6000) with a `truncated` flag for the ~10 mega-frequency function words. The
    book rail / OT-NT tabs / rendering chips all narrow it. The occurrence list (all-books OR a single
    book) renders **50 at a time with a "See more" (+50)** button (80-lexicon.jsx `visibleCount`).
- **Word-source toggle (focused word): ABP · HEB · KJV · BSB** (2026-06-22) — a number's occurrences,
  book distribution, and "renders as" in each. **Hebrew DEFAULTS to HEB = heb.db (the REAL Hebrew OT, NOT
  the old KJV bridge); the ~150 byform/Aramaic/name numbers heb.db lacks fall back to KJV (`has_heb` false).**
  Greek defaults to ABP. KJV/BSB stay explicit text toggles (KJV-as-text untouched). `lexicon_profile/books/
  verses` carry per-source branches + `has_abp/has_heb/has_kjv/has_bsb` + `abp/heb/kjv/bsb_glosses`; heb/bsb
  occurrence lists re-fetch per-verse in `VerseRow` (heb = an ALIGNED interlinear: each Hebrew word
  stacked over its gloss, laid LTR — letters stay RTL — replacing the old two-opposite-direction
  Hebrew-line + gloss-line that never lined up; `.corpus-heb-int`/`.chi-*` CSS; bsb mirrors KJV). The
  English-word finder shows all 4 "renders as" lines per word + a HEB/BSB filter, each line carrying that
  SOURCE'S TOTAL count (2026-06-22 — matches the word's own study page, counted the way `lexicon_profile`
  does; the lone ambiguous count on the right was dropped; HEB total folds homographs via `_heb_match`). The
  Hebrew object-marker אֵת H853 is dropped from the finder (`_HEB_FUNCTION_STRONGS`, the Hebrew analog of the
  Greek function-word filter — caveat: et's "him/them" suffix forms share H853 so they drop too). Full record:
  memory `project_hebrew_source_swap`.
- LexiconView is always-mounted (display:none) so state survives tab switches

## Search Tab — REMOVED (2026-06-23)
- The old standalone Search tab and its `/api/search` endpoint are GONE (route + its KJV helpers
  + the unused `api.search` frontend helper deleted, commit 6eaec4e). **views_search.py now hosts
  ONLY `/api/text-search`.** Live search = the Library in-text search (`/api/text-search`) + Word
  study (`/api/lexicon/*`) + Ask the corpus (`/api/ai-search`). Don't wire new work to `/api/search`.

## AI Search
- SQL gen + term-extraction on **Haiku**; the displayed **synthesis + verse curation (pass 2) on
  Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, 2026-06-21 — Haiku parroted the question's framing on nuanced
  "same vs different" questions and over-asserts; same lesson as xref/summary)
- **Daily spend caps (2026-06-22; user tier lowered 5→3 on 2026-06-23).** Ask-corpus is capped per
  account/UTC-day (user 3 / berean 10 /
  admin unlimited + uncounted) AND by a whole-site daily ceiling (~50 ≈ $2). Enforced server-side in
  `ai_search` BEFORE any model runs (`ai_caller`/`ai_quota_blocked`/`ai_quota_count` in views_notes.py;
  counts in notes.db `ai_usage`); cached/reopened answers never count, counted only on success. Knobs =
  `AI_DAILY_LIMITS` + `AI_SITE_DAILY` atop views_notes.py. Frontend (52-ask-corpus.jsx): 3 follow-ups
  per thread, a repeated question in a thread doesn't fire, composer locks mid-search, "N left today"
  counter. The no-login News share link can't use corpus (login-gated; the news key isn't auth), so the
  site cap covers every non-admin search. Full record: memory `project_ai_spend_caps`.
- Berean system prompt — no imported theology
- key_strongs: up to 10 chips (6 Greek + 4 Hebrew max)
- Empty-result retry (LAST RESORT, 2026-06-21): Haiku broadens the SQL only when the first query
  AND the cheap fallbacks (explanation-cited verses, proper-noun english LIKE) ALL come up empty —
  not the instant the SQL is empty. Saved a wasted ~5s call on Hebrew/empty searches.
- **Hebrew evidence from heb.db (2026-06-22):** a Hebrew target (H-number) pulls a canonical SPREAD of its
  REAL occurrences from heb_words (code-side supplement, mirrors the cognate/phrase ones), injected + tagged
  with the H-number so the citation guard counts them and the answer reads grounded. The model's KJV-bridge
  SQL (BDB → kjv_strongs → ABP) stays as a fallback. heb.db reads guarded; verses ABP's versification lacks
  are skipped (can't display). `_CACHE_CODE_VER`→37. Verse evidence has an **ABP·BSB·KJV·HEB display toggle**
  (per-turn in `AcTurn`, 50/52-corpus files; the shared `VerseRow` already renders all four). It ALWAYS
  defaults to ABP — the old auto-show-HEB-for-Hebrew-answers was dropped 2026-06-22 (user's call). HEB grays
  unless the answer has OT verses, and shows ONLY those OT verses when picked (heb.db is OT-only, so a mixed
  Greek+Hebrew answer no longer renders blank rows) — gate is `hasOtVerse` = any non-`NT_BOOKS` result.
  Memory `project_hebrew_source_swap`.
- **Speed shape (2026-06-21): model-bound.** terms ~1s + write-SQL ~5s (Haiku) + pass-2 synthesis
  ~11-12s (Sonnet, scales with how many verses it reads); DB ~0.1s. **Phrase queries no longer scan
  the 600k word-gloss:** a multi-word `english LIKE '%phrase%'` is re-run against the FULL verse text
  (`verses.text` + `kjv_verses` + `bsb_verses`, ~31k rows each) in code (the phrase supplement), and a phrase-ONLY query
  (phrase LIKE, no Strong's-number filter) SKIPS the gloss SQL entirely — it was ~6-7s and fruitless
  (cut a live "son of perdition" 15→9s). The proper-noun name-scan only fires when results are thin
  (`< _PROPER_NOUN_NEED`) — a common capitalized word like "Sabbath" was burning ~7s on a redundant
  scan. Timing `log.info("ai_search timing …")` kept on, plus per-call `cache[haiku-sqlgen]`/
  `cache[sonnet-pass2]` token-split lines + a `SLOW SQL` (>10s DB step) warning — a cost/stall meter
  (grep the PA `*.log`; ~3¢/search, Haiku SQL prompt caches, Sonnet pass-2 can't). "Stream verses
  first" = a not-yet-done frontend idea. Full record: memory `project_ai_search_architecture`.
- **Citation guard + grounding (2026-06-21).** Occurrence lists are pulled by Strong's = unfakeable;
  the leak is in the PROSE. A verse the model names/adds is checked against the target Strong's set —
  one containing NONE of the target words is `is_thematic` → frontend "Additional references" (kept,
  labeled, never primary). REGIME-AWARE: no target word (broad question) ⇒ no flag. The pass-1 prose
  is written from MEMORY before retrieval (can get a verse number wrong — it once wrote 2Th 3:3 for
  2:3), so the DISPLAYED explanation is ALWAYS the pass-2 GROUNDED one whenever the answer names a
  verse, even a short one (pass-2 is told to cite ONLY from the real retrieved list). Ranking is
  skipped only for a small pool whose prose cites nothing. Separate pass-3 dropped (folded into
  pass-2). Full record: memory `project_ai_search_architecture`.
- **Synthesis inputs + seatbelt (2026-06-21).** The verses handed to pass-2 are a SPREAD across books
  (`_spread_sample`: round-robin a few per book, not `results[:N]` — which, ordered by verse id, was
  early-OT-only, so a both-testament word came back OT-only and mislabeled "the LXX"); within each book
  the most cross-referenced verse (TSK count via `_xref_scores`, falls back to position order on any
  miss) wins the seat. Frontend SEATBELT (`AcProse` in 52-ask-corpus.jsx): the synthesis prose only
  LINKS a verse ref that's actually in the retrieved results — a verse the model named but we never
  retrieved renders as plain (unverified) text.
- **Honest empty-state + neutrality (2026-06-21).** Payload carries `grounded: false` when the search
  found no real occurrence (SQL 0 rows AND every shown verse is thematic/model-named); the frontend
  shows a pale-amber "no direct occurrences" caveat instead of a confident write-up. Both explanation
  prompts (`_AI_SYSTEM_TMPL` + `_CURATION_SYSTEM`) carry a NEUTRALITY rule — answer from the text, not
  the question's framing ("same?" vs "different?" must give the same answer; if the text doesn't
  settle it, say so. Killed the parrot-the-framing bug.)
- **Same-root cognate supplement (2026-06-22).** After the SQL runs, each GREEK target's same-root
  family is pulled in deterministically (`_greek_cognates` + the `_cognate_is_tight` stem filter in
  ai.py) — the relative's verses + a chip, but ONLY if it actually occurs (e.g. σαββατισμός G4520 /
  Heb 4:9 under σάββατον). Greek only (BDB has no etymology). A code/context change like this isn't in
  the search fingerprint → bump `_CACHE_CODE_VER` (now 38). Memory `project_ai_search_architecture`.
- **Synthesis standing rules — Berean (2026-06-22).** The displayed note (`_CURATION_SYSTEM`, mirrored
  in `_AI_SYSTEM_TMPL`): NO doctrinal verdicts (never rule a practice binding/abolished/etc. or assign a
  stance to an author — report the verse, let the reader conclude); contested "is X binding" questions
  are IN SCOPE (answer, withhold only the verdict — never refuse/deflect/rephrase); prose uses
  transliteration + Strong's number, NEVER raw Greek/Hebrew script (that's for the chips). All
  LOAD-BEARING. + REPORT, DON'T CHARACTERIZE (8721341, tested live): every clause must pin to a verse
  that states it — killed the soft-framing slop ("instituted at creation"/"reinterpreted") via the FRAME
  + a worked example, NOT a blacklist. + a SABBATH-vs-WEEK lexical note (σάββατον = the seven-day WEEK in
  the "first/one of the sabbaths" idiom — 1Co 16:2 etc., overrides ABP's wooden gloss) + no "what the
  verse doesn't do" riders. Memory `project_ai_synthesis_quality`.
- **Follow-ups (Ask the corpus) carry the recent thread** — last 6 turns + their key lemmas, sent as a
  `context` query param, woven into the term + SQL prompts only to resolve references ("it"/"the same
  word"). A "New thread" button (rail) resets. Follow-ups are never cached (thread-specific).
- Cached in ai_search_cache, ver_key=`search:<hash>` (fingerprint of system prompt +
  `_CURATION_SYSTEM` + book list + `_CACHE_CODE_VER` salt). See "AI result cache" below.
- The cache ROW KEY (the query text) is NORMALIZED (`_cache_key` in ai.py: lowercase,
  punctuation→space, collapse spaces), so caps / punctuation / extra-space variants of the same
  question reuse one cached answer instead of paying for a fresh search (2026-06-23). Only the KEY
  is normalized — the models still get the user's original wording. Search-path only (the other AI
  caches key off their own raw query). Follow-ups (with `context`) are still never cached.

## AI result cache (ai_search_cache) — prompt-fingerprint scheme
Full record: memory `project_ai_cache_unify`; the synthesis model map + the author lesson:
memory `project_ai_synthesis_quality`.
- Every AI synthesis caches here with `ver_key = "<category>:<sha1-of-its-own-prompt>"` — categories
  `search:` (ai.py), `summary:` (views_summary.py), `xref:` (views_crossref.py), `pn:` (views_metav.py),
  `chrono:` (views_chrono.py, key `chrono_intro:<day>`). Editing a prompt changes only its category's
  hash, so just that cache refreshes — no manual version bump. The row key is stable + unique, so a
  regen overwrites the stale row in place. (xref, chapter summary, AND the ask-corpus synthesis/curation
  run on Sonnet; the rest on Haiku.)
- Helpers in core.py: `ai_fingerprint(category, *parts)`, `ai_cache_get(query, ver_key)` (an old-prompt
  row misses → regenerates), `ai_cache_put`, `ai_cache_prune(category, keep_prefix)`. Each category
  prunes ONLY its own stale rows at startup (app.py).
- **LANDMINE:** a delete must be scoped to its OWN category (search's startup cleanup is `search:%`
  only). If you add a new cache category, give it its own `<category>:<hash>` tag + its own startup
  prune — never widen another category's delete.
- summary rows add a per-book author suffix `summary:<tpl-hash>:<author-hash>`. `_BOOK_AUTHORS`
  (views_summary.py) feeds the BOOK BLURB only, NOT the chapter summary — well-established authors +
  named scribes only, the rest left blank on purpose (don't hard-push Haiku on disputed authors;
  memory `project_ai_synthesis_quality`).
- LSJ word-study summaries live in `lsj.summary_json` / `abp_ext.summary_json`, NOT this table, but
  self-heal the same way: a `_synth_ver` stamp (= `ai_fingerprint("lsj", ...)` in views_lsj.py) is
  checked on read and dropped/regenerated when the prompt changes — so editing the LSJ prompt
  auto-refreshes too, no clear script needed. The LSJ blurb is a Haiku **"definition"** prompt (open
  with the meaning; Koine anchor, no book-naming; favor-not-grace example) + per-word **"Lexica"
  overrides** shown DIRECTLY, no model call, for the loaded lemmas LSJ leads classical on
  (`_LSJ_OVERRIDES`/`_ovkey` in views_lsj.py — badged "Lexica" not LSJ; the Summary|Full-entry toggle
  still shows raw LSJ). Full record: memory `project_lsj_overrides`.

## BibleHub ABP Scrape
- Scraper: `scripts/scrape_biblehub_abp.py` — captures strongs, greek_pos, italic (last-word
  heuristic), strips `[ ]` brackets. The scrape (`bh_scrape.db`) is complete.
- The words table is rebuilt from `bh_scrape.db` — see the `/rebuild-words` command + "Database
  Tables → words". (morph column: filled to ~78% at rebuild #6; further fill scrapped 2026-06-15 —
  memory `project_abp_morph_gap`.)
- **Do NOT add conjugated manuscript forms** — the audience are non-Greek readers (standing rule).

## cross_references table
- Columns: id, verse_id, verse_ref_id
- Both IDs map to kjv_verses.verse_id
- 386,518 rows loaded from Torrey's TSK
- Join pattern: cross_references cr JOIN kjv_verses kv ON cr.verse_ref_id = kv.verse_id

## MetaV (person/place sidebar)
- Tables: `metav_people` (+_aliases, _groups, _relationships), `metav_places` (+_aliases; has lat/lon, strongs_g)
- Looked up by NAME (not strongs). Frontend fetches person + place in parallel; toggle shown when both exist
- **KJV/BSB reader word → metaV name gate (2026-06-23):** the lookup fires only when the word's Strong's is a
  NAME (proper noun or gentilic) per `core._HEB_NAME_STRONGS` — a startup set built from heb.db morphology by
  DOMINANT use (`app._build_heb_name_cache`, mirrors `_FUNCTION_STRONGS`; endpoints send `heb_name`,
  `30-detail-panel.jsx` gates `kjvIsPN` on `entry.hebName`; Greek/NT + no-heb.db fall back to capitals).
  Killed bogus place cards for common words BSB caps mid-verse (midbar "Wilderness of Sinai") without hiding
  clans BDB tags "Adjective" (Philistines). Place comments also strip a bare wiki URL. Memory `project_metav_expansion`.
- Hebrew proper nouns: route to metaV (person/place) with BDB stacked BELOW (KJV-style). `isHebrewWord` (any H#)
  drives BDB; `isHebrew = isHebrewWord && !isPN` drives the Hebrew hero/LSJ suppression
- Default tab (Phase 6): trusts the word's OWN tipnr type via `pn_types` (a SET — 'person'/'place'/
  'person,place'). A clean single type is authoritative; ambiguous ('person,place', a genuinely shared
  number like Adam H121) or absent pn_types falls back to the strongs_g heuristic (place's G-number
  matching the word's strongs_base — note metav_places.strongs_g only holds G-numbers, so OT/H words
  always fall through to Person unless pn_types pins them). The Person/Place toggle is SUPPRESSED when
  pn_types is a clean single type (the other metaV card is a name-coincidence).
- tipnr schema (Phase 6, backlog #5): `entity_types` column holds the type SET so a strongs shared by a
  person AND a place keeps BOTH (was a PK collision: last-imported type won → Adam H121 read 'place').
  `entity_type` = single primary token (legacy). Migration adds the column at PA startup; re-run
  import_tipnr.py after any rebuild to populate. Old "do NOT trust entity_type" rule is now obsolete —
  pn_types (the set) is trustworthy.
- Gentilics (`/ites?$/`: Hivite, Sinite…): card labeled "People / Clan", place header "Homeland", AI summary
  fires on the clan tab. Kept as persons (Table-of-Nations genealogy is the value; only Jebusite has map coords)
- AI curation: `/api/metav/ai-description/<name>` — Haiku, 1-2 sentences, SCOPED to the clicked
  book/ch/verse ("describe the one AT this reference"; cached per-reference `pn:<name>:<bk><ch>:<v>`;
  badged "not verse-checked"). Fills entries with no metaV/BDB data. The place endpoint also withholds
  the map pin when the name maps to >1 place or the matched row lacks its own coords. Both = **Fix A**,
  the permanent floor under whatever the binder below can't bind.
- **VERSE-BOUND ENTITY CARD — the Issue-2 rebuild, LIVE 2026-06-28.** A PN click now first asks
  `GET /api/metav/entity/<name>?book=&chapter=&verse=` (views_metav.py) for the verse-CORRECT TIPNR entity
  (from `pn_binding`); when bound it LEADS the rail with a sourced `.pnbound` card (canonical name + TIPNR
  description + kin + region + "Appears N×" + "Matched to this verse" + a TIPNR badge) and a bind GATES the
  whole name-based metaV fetch (kills the name-guess person/place card + its Groups + Nave's + place-LSJ at
  once). 404 → the old name-path + Fix A, byte-same (deploy-safe). 14,817 binds, zero confident-wrong; TIPNR
  is the identity spine, metaV is enrichment only. Engine = **`entity_resolution.py`** (repo root, pure
  logic); tables built by `scripts/build_entity_binding.py --apply`. **The map staying hidden on an
  ambiguous bound place (Eden) is Fix A's guard working, NOT a bug.** Full record + the build-order +
  lessons: memory `project_entity_resolution_rebuild`.
- CRITICAL: the lexicon join is `LEFT JOIN lexicon l ON l.strongs_g = w.strongs_base` (Phase 1 indexed key).
  strongs_g only ever holds 'G…', so a Hebrew H-number can never match — this STRUCTURALLY replaced the old
  `SUBSTR(strongs_base,2) ... LIKE 'G%'` guard that a Hebrew H121 used to slip past (bogus Greek G121 lemma
  made the metaV effect early-return and broke Hebrew-PN metaV). Applies to BOTH chapter_text and verse_words

## Maintenance / data-quality scripts
- `scripts/health_check.py <db>` — READ-ONLY scanner; run after ANY import/rebuild. ~14 checks (strongs_base
  invariant, dups, misalignment, fragmented brackets, missing/orphan greek_pos, strongs range, lexicon/bdb
  coverage) + person/place overlap report. Should be 0 warnings. `--email [--only-warn] [--email-to=addr]`
  mails the report via `mailer.py` (the nightly PA task; SMTP creds from `~/bible-db/.env`).
- `fix_greek_pos_gaps.py` / `fix_bracket_gaps_absorb.py` / `fix_orphan_greek_pos.py` / `dedup_words.py` —
  targeted data repairs, all with `--dry-run`. Touch only the named column; never blanket DELETE
- `audit_split_flip.py <db>` (READ-ONLY) + `fix_split_flip.py <db> [--apply]` — the "LORD the" flip
  (a determiner stranded AFTER its noun, vs the clean `verses.text`). Audit shares its detector with the
  fixer (`find_flips`) so they can't drift; the fixer swaps each pair toward `verses.text` order and LOOPS
  to convergence (a list "the A the B" needs several monotonic passes). Root-fixed in the build
  (`_split_compounds` fronts spread words in source-phrase order), so this is a one-time live cleanup;
  re-run surface+translit after `--apply`. 283 verses fixed + verified 2026-06-28. Memory `project_split_compounds_flip`.
- `fix_emdash.py` (`--dry-run` / `--apply`) — swaps ABP's literal `--` clause dash for an em-dash `—` in
  `words.english` + `verses.text` (double hyphen only; single hyphens like Beer-sheba are safe). Reversible;
  PA-only data step; RE-RUN after any words/verses rebuild (not folded into the build). Memory `project_library_bracket`.
- `fix_italic_heads.py` (`--dry-run` / `--apply`, `--strongs G####`, `--all`) — makes a slot's SEARCH LABEL
  (`words.english_head`, what the Word-study finder matches) its OWN rendering, never a translator-added
  (italic) word ("take favor" had labeled λαμβάνω/G2983 "favor"). english_head ONLY; re-runnable. UNLIKE the
  others this IS build-folded (`_strip_italic_heads` in build_words_from_abp.py), so a normal rebuild
  reproduces it — no re-run needed. 4,409 fixed 2026-06-25. Memory `project_english_head_label`.
- `fix_pn_subject_merge.py` (`--apply` / `--list-skipped`, dry-run default) — splits a subject NAME that
  ABP crammed onto its verb's cell back onto its own clickable `*` slot (name on the LOWER slot, verb keeps
  its number; bracketed cases keep both in-bracket sharing the reorder number so reading order is unchanged).
  2,297 fixed 2026-06-26 (2,278 flat + 19 bracketed) + 2 εἰμί copula merges 2026-06-28 (Sarai Gen 11:30,
  Crete Zep 2:6 — subjects not in the tipnr roster; `_peel_eimi` fires on a G1510 cell with a capitalized
  non-roster lead + adjacent empty `*`, minus function-word leads, unbracketed slot-after only). Build-folded
  (`apply_pn_subject_split`, runs after insert, BEFORE import_tipnr resolves the new name slots). After
  `--apply`: re-run import_tipnr → build_abp_surface → build_abp_translit. Audit for the εἰμί class:
  `scripts/audit_eimi_subject_merge.py`. Memory `project_pn_subject_verb_fold`.
- `build_entity_binding.py` (dry-run default / `--apply`) + `fix_cushi_strongs.py` (dry-run default /
  `--apply`) — the Issue-2 entity-binding build + the Cushi by-verse Strong's correction (6 "Cushi*" slots in
  2Sa 18, H3570→H3569, never global). Both PA-only, reversible; **re-run BOTH after any words rebuild**
  (build_entity_binding re-tiers from live metaV; the Cushi fix is re-introduced by a rebuild). Binder logic
  lives in `entity_resolution.py`. Memory `project_entity_resolution_rebuild`.

## Rate limiting / security (2026-06-07 security pass)
- `core.limiter` (flask-limiter, memory storage): site-wide default `300/min` per endpoint per IP
  (flood backstop on the DB routes); paid AI endpoints set tighter `@limiter.limit("200 per hour")`
  which overrides the default. Static assets exempted via a `request_filter` in app.py (page loads
  never trip it). 429s handled by the errorhandler in app.py.
- AI-generated SQL runs on a READ-ONLY connection (`db_ro`), single-statement, SELECT-only guard;
  failures log the SQL/error server-side ONLY (never returned to the client — info disclosure).
- Verdict: read-only, no-auth, no-PII public app; all user input is parameterized; secrets via .env
  (gitignored); Flask debug off in prod (app.run(debug=True) is local-only). No critical findings.

## Refactor backlog (status 2026-06-07 — redesign Phases 0–6 done)
- See memory `project_architecture_rework.md` and TODO.md. DONE: #1 centralize Strong's handling (Phase 1 —
  `lexicon.strongs_g` join key + frontend `strongsBare`/`strongsTag`); #2 patch-fold (2026-06-09 — the six
  shape-keyed cleanup scripts now run INSIDE build_words_from_abp.py as one self-correcting pass; proven
  byte-identical to the old build+14-patch chain via compare_words.py; see "Words rebuild checklist"); #3
  backend DRY serialization (Phase 2, `_serialize_word_core`); #4 detail-panel state (Phase 4,
  `{hero, sections[]}`); #5 tipnr PK collision (Phase 6, `entity_types` type-set). REMAINING: the
  destructive-DELETE half of #2 stays (copy-first neutralises it — user's call 2026-06-09) and the frontend
  half of #3 (makeEntry/flattenAiResults dedup).

## Do Not
- Do not add KJV as the sole primary study text — ABP remains the anchor
- Do not touch existing ABP tables when adding unrelated features
- Do not commit bible.db to git
- NEVER run `DELETE FROM words` or `DELETE FROM verses` — OT and NT words are both in the words table; clearing destroys hard-to-recover data. If re-importing, use INSERT OR IGNORE (safe to re-run).
- Avoid the full DELETE+rebuild in `build_words_from_abp.py` unless truly necessary. It
  (a) clears `is_pn` and proper-noun Strong's, and (b) historically stripped the G prefix
  off strongs_base. The script is now patched (prefixes at INSERT, prints a reminder), but
  after ANY run you MUST re-run `import_tipnr.py` and verify the strongs_base invariant above.
- **The rebuild scripts NEVER write the live db (2026-06-28, after a parallel session blanked
  bible.db).** `build_words_from_abp.py` + `build_words_from_bh.py` now build into a throwaway
  `bible.db.new` copy (a consistent online snapshot of the live db); the live file is never opened
  for writing, and you swap the copy in by hand with one reversible move. The in-place
  `DELETE FROM words` is gone. Full record: memory `project_db_backups`.

## Backups — `scripts/backup_db.py` (added 2026-06-28)
- The live dbs are PA-only + not in git, and a careless session has blanked bible.db. `backup_db.py`
  is the floor: a daily, VERIFIED, rotating backup of EVERY live db (auto-discovers `*.db` —
  bible/notes/study/esv/niv/heb/news/bh_scrape), kept in `~/db_backups/` OUTSIDE the repo so a
  folder-nuke can't reach them. Uses SQLite's online `.backup()` (safe on a live WAL db, no torn
  copy), a `PRAGMA quick_check` gate (a bad copy never rotates out a good one), gzip + chmod 0444 on
  older copies, and a `.info` manifest per copy so `--list` shows row counts instantly. Restore =
  pick a stamp from `--list`, `gunzip -c` (or cp) over a `.new`, swap with the reversible `mv`.
  **`study.db` is the one irreplaceable file (hand-authored argument graphs, no rebuild script).**
  LIVE as a daily PA scheduled task (13:30 UTC, `--keep 7`). Full record: memory `project_db_backups`.

## Words rebuild checklist (if you ever rebuild the words table)
The full step-by-step lives in the **`/rebuild-words`** slash command
(`.claude/commands/rebuild-words.md`): copy-first → single self-correcting build → tail patches →
the audit gates → swap/deploy → re-run the dotted-lexicon/surface/translit/two-ending builders. It's a rare,
high-stakes job, so the 90-line procedure is kept out of this always-loaded file. The hard SAFETY
rules for the words table stay in **Do Not** above; background in memory
`project_architecture_rework`.
