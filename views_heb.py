"""Hebrew OT interlinear — a PUBLIC reading text (Westminster Leningrad Codex).

Unlike views_esv.py / views_niv.py (owner-only copyrighted texts), the Hebrew is
public domain, so these routes are OPEN — no owner gate, served like ABP/KJV/BSB.
The text lives in its OWN file, heb.db (core.heb_db), loaded on PA by
scripts/load_hebrew.py — never in bible.db, never in git (*.db is gitignored).

Right-to-left rendering happens in the frontend; here we just hand back each word
with its Hebrew (vowel points, no chant accents), Strong's H-number, grammar code,
and short English gloss, in reading order. The H-number drives the existing BDB
lexicon sidebar, so word-clicks light up with no extra wiring.

During rollout the FRONTEND shows the HEB toggle only to the owner (status.owner)
so visitors don't see a half-loaded OT; flip that to status.available once all 39
books are in. The data route itself stays public the whole time (public-domain text).

Endpoints:
  GET /api/hebrew/status                          -> {available: bool, owner: bool}
  GET /api/hebrew/chapter/<book>/<chapter>        -> [{verse, heading, words:[...]}]
  GET /api/hebrew/verse-words/<book>/<ch>/<verse> -> {words:[...]}  (one verse, for the side card)
