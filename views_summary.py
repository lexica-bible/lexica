"""Library reading-pane summaries (book blurb + pericope-aware chapter summary).

Powers the right panel's DEFAULT content in the Library: when no word or verse is
selected, the reader sees a short Berean orientation to the book plus a few
sentences on the chapter they're on. Haiku-backed, anchored in the actual English
text (ABP `verses.text`, or a non-canonical text's `<book>_verses.english`).

Both halves are cached independently in ai_search_cache:
  - book blurb     →  query="summary_book:<book>"
  - chapter summary→  query="summary_ch:<book>:<chapter>"
with ver_key="summary" so a code-version cache bump preserves them (same treatment
as the 'xref' caches). Endpoint is rate-limited like the other paid AI routes.

_SUMMARY_SYSTEM = """\
You are a textual scholar working from a Berean approach: the text speaks first. \
Let the actual words of the passage anchor everything you write. Import no \
systematic theology, no denominational framework, and no doctrinal assumptions \
from outside the text itself — follow where the words lead. You may, however, name the traditionally recognized author, \
audience, and historical setting of a book when these are well established (for example, \
that 1 John is the apostle John's letter, or that Romans is Paul writing to the church in \
Rome), even when the passage at hand does not name them — that is ordinary background, not \
imported doctrine. Do not hedge a well-known author as an unnamed "writer." You may note plain \
eschatological themes when the text itself raises them, but do not impose them. \
Never invent events or claims the text does not contain. Never mention any app, \
database, data source, or translation by name. Do not begin with a label, heading, \
or prefix of any kind — start directly with the first sentence. Write in plain, \
direct, readable language — not academic jargon. Each sentence must be one complete \
thought.\
