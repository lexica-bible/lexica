# TODO

## Advanced Workspace Layout (major feature)

Desktop-only multi-panel workspace mode, alongside the existing single-focus layout. Three modes total:
- **Mobile** — current Lexica (reader + tap-to-open sidebar). No changes needed.
- **Desktop basic** — current Lexica. Default.
- **Desktop advanced** — resizable multi-panel workspace. Minimum viewport width gate.

Panels for advanced mode (based on eSword reference layout):
- Book/chapter navigator (persistent left sidebar, currently a dropdown)
- Bible text panel (center, full interlinear with inline Strong's)
- Cross-references panel (top right)
- Dictionary/lexicon panel (bottom right, currently opens as overlay sidebar)
- Notes panel (personal study notes per verse — new feature, needs DB table)

Draft a written spec of panel combinations and behavior before implementing. Feed spec + styles.css + app.jsx to Claude for design/implementation plan.

## Quick Wins

### Cross-Reference Count Badge
Show a small ref count on each verse in Library so heavily cross-referenced verses (Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, etc.) are visible at a glance. Data already in `cross_references` table — just needs a count query and a UI badge.

## Planned Features

### Morphology Display
Show grammatical parsing (case, tense, number, etc.) in the word click sidebar in plain English: "Verb · Aorist · Active · Indicative · 3rd Person · Singular". Morphological data source: MorphGNT (NT) + CATSS/CCAT (LXX OT) — needs import into a `morph` column on the `words` table.

### Parallel Mode Synchronized Scrolling
In Parallel mode, the ABP and KJV columns scroll independently. Synchronized scrolling would keep both columns aligned by verse as the user scrolls.

### Parallel Mode Versification Alignment
ABP follows LXX verse numbering (Psalms especially can be off by 1 from KJV). In Parallel mode, mismatched verses currently show blank on one side. Need to: (1) audit how bad the mismatch is in practice, (2) decide whether to offset-map or leave gaps.

## MetaV

### ✓ People & Places — DONE
People sidebar (bio, relationships, genealogy), places sidebar (Leaflet map, coordinates), proper noun routing in both ABP and KJV. All live.

### Topic Index
Use MetaV `Topics.csv` and `TopicIndex.csv` as a structured alternative to AI search — browse by concept (Atonement, Covenant, Resurrection, Holy Spirit etc.) rather than searching. Each topic → curated verse set with full interlinear. Could be a fourth nav tab or a browse mode within Search. Good entry point for users who don't know what to search for.

## Library Expansion (texts + morphology)

### Morphology Data Sources

One dataset per language, accessed via two paths (ABP direct / KJV via kjv_strongs):

| Source | Language | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| [CATSS](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/) | OT Greek (LXX) | ABP OT words directly |
| [macula-greek](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek) | NT Greek | ABP NT words directly; KJV NT via kjv_strongs |
| [macula-hebrew](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-hebrew) or [morphhb](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb) | Hebrew (MT) | KJV OT via kjv_strongs |

**Access paths:**
- ABP OT word click → CATSS morphology
- ABP NT word click → macula-greek morphology
- KJV OT word click → macula-hebrew/morphhb via kjv_strongs
- KJV NT word click → macula-greek via kjv_strongs (same dataset, different path)

**Notes:**
- CATSS is tagged against Rahlfs LXX, not ABP directly — expect versification mismatches similar to the BH alignment problem; position-based alignment should work
- morphhb is more mature/battle-tested than macula-hebrew for basic morphology display; macula-hebrew is richer if deeper linguistic analysis is ever wanted
- All stored in a `morph` column on `words` table (ABP path) or looked up by Strong's number (KJV path)

### Textus Receptus (TR) NT Integration
Public domain Greek NT, same Strong's numbering as ABP so word study infrastructure works without changes. Implementation: add as a NT text toggle alongside ABP (ABP | TR). Use case: textual criticism — ABP and TR diverge in a few hundred NT places, showing differences side by side is uniquely valuable. No free tool does this well. Needs a tagged TR source — Robinson-Pierpont Byzantine text has community Strong's tagging.

### Additional Bible Texts (scrollmapper/bible_databases)
- Large collection of public domain translations in structured formats
- Evaluate: ASV, YLT, Darby, Geneva 1599 as scholarly comparison texts
- ESV: check licensing — likely restricted, confirm before importing
- Each additional translation needs its own word-level table if interlinear is wanted, or verse-level only for parallel reading

### Deuterocanonical / Pseudepigrapha
- **1 Enoch** — referenced in NT (Jude 1:14-15); available in public domain English translations
- **Dead Sea Scrolls** — partial OT texts with textual variants; check what structured digital editions exist
- These would be a separate "Apocrypha" section, not mixed into canonical OT/NT
- Research available structured sources before committing to import
