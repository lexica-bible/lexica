# TODO

## Advanced Workspace Layout (major feature)

### Spec

**Three layout modes:**
- **Mobile** — current Lexica unchanged. Tap-to-open sidebar overlay.
- **Desktop basic** — current Lexica unchanged. Default for desktop.
- **Desktop advanced** — multi-panel workspace. Opt-in via toggle in the header. Minimum viewport width gate (e.g. 1100px). User-resizable panels via draggable dividers (clean implementation only).

**Panel layout:**

```
┌─────────┬──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│ Books   │                          │  Cross-refs / Search / │
│ (left)  │   Library (center)       │  Notes  (top right)    │
│         │                          ├────────────────────────┤
│         │                          │  Word Study            │
│         │                          │  LSJ / BDB / MetaV     │
│         │                          │  (bottom right)        │
└─────────┴──────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

**Left panel — Book/Chapter Navigator:**
- Always-visible book list (replaces dropdown)
- Click a book → chapter numbers expand inline below it (accordion)
- Only one book expanded at a time
- Collapsible on desktop (narrows to icons or hides) to reclaim center width
- On mobile: hidden, existing dropdown stays

**Center panel — Library:**
- ABP / KJV / Parallel toggle, all existing chip/interlinear controls
- Word click → updates Word Study panel in place (no overlay)
- Verse number click → opens Cross-refs tab in top-right panel
- Full height, scrollable
- **Reading modes:**
  - *Chip mode* — current default, all words individually clickable
  - *Prose mode* — dense reading view, inline Strong's superscripts (eSword-style), no stacked interlinear
  - Interlinear toggle (Greek row on/off) available in chip mode
- **Parallel mode** — auto-collapses left nav to give center panel full width; user can re-expand manually

**Top-right panel — tabs: Cross-refs | Search | Notes**
- **Cross-refs**: existing TSK curated panel (currently opens as overlay)
- **Search**: lexicon browse + AI search combined, toggle between them inside the tab
- **Notes**: personal study notes per verse (future — needs `notes` DB table)
- Default tab: Cross-refs

**Bottom-right panel — Word Study:**
- Always live, updates on word click from Library
- LSJ, BDB, MetaV — same content as current sidebar
- Replaces the overlay sidebar entirely in advanced mode

**Resizing:**
- Draggable vertical divider between left nav and center
- Draggable vertical divider between center and right panels
- Draggable horizontal divider between top-right and bottom-right
- Sizes persist in localStorage

**Toggle:**
- Header button (e.g. ⊞ icon) switches between basic and advanced
- State persists in localStorage
- Only shown above minimum viewport width

## Search Layout Revamp (plan together)
- Overall search layout needs optimizing — spacing, hierarchy, result cards
- Audit whether library display improvements (verse numbers neutral, interlinear hierarchy, gold overuse) carried over to search result verses — likely they did not since search uses different component classes
- Align search verse rendering with library standards where appropriate

## ✓ Text Structure Session — DONE

### ✓ Pericopes / Section Headings
`pericopes` table created and populated (2431 headings, full canon). Backend: `chapter_text()` LEFT JOINs pericopes, folds `heading` into verse object. Frontend: `renderVerse()` injects `.pericope-heading` div before verse when heading is present. Works in chip, prose, and parallel (ABP column only). Note: Song of Solomon has 0 headings — BibleHub doesn't carry them; not a bug.

### ✓ Prose Mode — Continuous Flow
Non-poetry books wrap as a single flowing paragraph in prose mode with inline verse-number superscripts. Poetry books (Psa/Pro/Job/Son/Lam/Ecc) keep line-per-verse. `renderProseWords()` helper shared by both paths.

### ✓ Font Size Preference
A−/A+ in desktop lib-bar and mobile modes sheet. `--lib-font-size` CSS custom property on `.lib-reading`. Persisted in localStorage. Defaults: 15px mobile / 18px desktop. Range 13–24px.

## Planned Features

### ✓ Prose Reading Mode — DONE
Chip/Prose toggle live. Prose renders clickable inline word spans, no chip borders. Further work (continuous flow, poetry detection) tracked in Text Structure Session above.

### Morphology Display
Show grammatical parsing (case, tense, number, etc.) in the word click sidebar in plain English: "Verb · Aorist · Active · Indicative · 3rd Person · Singular". Morphological data source: MorphGNT (NT) + CATSS/CCAT (LXX OT) — needs import into a `morph` column on the `words` table.

### Parallel Mode Versification Alignment
ABP follows LXX verse numbering (Psalms especially can be off by 1 from KJV). In Parallel mode, mismatched verses currently show blank on one side. Need to: (1) audit how bad the mismatch is in practice, (2) decide whether to offset-map or leave gaps.

## MetaV

### ✓ People & Places — DONE
People sidebar (bio, relationships, genealogy), places sidebar (Leaflet map, coordinates), proper noun routing in both ABP and KJV. All live.

### Topic Index
Browse by concept (Atonement, Covenant, Resurrection, Holy Spirit etc.) as a structured alternative to AI search. Good entry point for users who don't know what to search for.

**Approach:** use MetaV topic *names* only as a category scaffold — throw away their verse mappings entirely (MetaV topics reflect evangelical Protestant systematic theology, which conflicts with the Berean approach). Generate all content ourselves:
- Topic names: MetaV `Topics.csv` as a starting list, curated/renamed to remove theologically loaded framing
- Verse selection: our own Strong's-driven corpus query per topic
- Synthesis: Haiku with Berean system prompt, anchored in ABP vocabulary

Could be a fourth nav tab or a browse mode within Search.

**Implementation order:** use MetaV topic-to-verse mappings as-is for POC — validate the UX and feature usage first. Once proven, swap in our own Strong's-driven verse selection and Haiku synthesis. No point building the full pipeline before the feature is validated.

## Library Expansion (texts + morphology)

### Morphology Data Sources

One dataset per language, accessed via two paths (ABP direct / KJV via kjv_strongs):

| Source | Language | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| [CATSS](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/) | OT Greek (LXX) | ABP OT words directly |
| [macula-greek](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek) | NT Greek | ABP NT words directly; KJV NT via kjv_strongs |
| [macula-hebrew](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-hebrew) or [morphhb](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb) | Hebrew (MT) | KJV OT via kjv_strongs |

**Access paths:**
- ABP OT word click → CATSS morphology
- ABP NT word click → macula-greek morphology
- KJV OT word click → macula-hebrew/morphhb via kjv_strongs
- KJV NT word click → macula-greek via kjv_strongs (same dataset, different path)

**Notes:**
- CATSS is tagged against Rahlfs LXX, not ABP directly — expect versification mismatches similar to the BH alignment problem; position-based alignment should work
- morphhb is more mature/battle-tested than macula-hebrew for basic morphology display; macula-hebrew is richer if deeper linguistic analysis is ever wanted
- All stored in a `morph` column on `words` table (ABP path) or looked up by Strong's number (KJV path)

### Textus Receptus (TR) NT Integration
Public domain Greek NT, same Strong's numbering as ABP so word study infrastructure works without changes. Implementation: add as a NT text toggle alongside ABP (ABP | TR). Use case: textual criticism — ABP and TR diverge in a few hundred NT places, showing differences side by side is uniquely valuable. No free tool does this well. Needs a tagged TR source — Robinson-Pierpont Byzantine text has community Strong's tagging.

### Additional Bible Texts (scrollmapper/bible_databases)
- Large collection of public domain translations in structured formats
- Evaluate: ASV, YLT, Darby, Geneva 1599 as scholarly comparison texts
- ESV: check licensing — likely restricted, confirm before importing
- Each additional translation needs its own word-level table if interlinear is wanted, or verse-level only for parallel reading

### Deuterocanonical / Pseudepigrapha
- **1 Enoch** — referenced in NT (Jude 1:14-15); available in public domain English translations
- **Dead Sea Scrolls** — partial OT texts with textual variants; check what structured digital editions exist
- These would be a separate "Apocrypha" section, not mixed into canonical OT/NT
- Research available structured sources before committing to import
