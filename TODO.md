# TODO

Open work only. Finished and scrapped items (with the gory details) are in [TODO_ARCHIVE.md](TODO_ARCHIVE.md).

Each item ends with a small `code:` line — that's just a pointer for Claude to find the right
spot. You can skip those lines.

## Code health / cleanup

The big rework is finished — all six phases are done and live (see
[REDESIGN_PLAN.md](REDESIGN_PLAN.md) and the memory notes). Done: Strong's plumbing centralized +
the fragile join gone (Phase 1); shared word-building code de-duplicated (Phase 2); the giant
`app.py` split into one tidy file per feature (Phase 3); the front end split up and the word pop-up's
tangle of on/off switches replaced with a "decide once, render simply" model (Phase 4); first-paint
speed-ups (Phase 5); and the person/place database quirk fixed so a shared name keeps both types
(Phase 6). A security pass and a code-health pass also ran (2026-06-07): flood protection added, a
minor info leak closed, dead code removed, an unbounded cache capped, an endpoint hardened.

Still open:

1. **Rebuild script is messy.** When the word table is rebuilt, the script wipes everything and
   then runs a long chain of patch scripts to fix it back up. It should be one clean pass that
   gets it right the first time. This is the riskiest part of the codebase to run. (Partly done: the
   safety-check slice is in — the build's own guards are now unit-tested — but the actual one-clean-
   pass rewrite remains. Best done the next time a rebuild is genuinely needed, copy-first.)
   `code: scripts/build_words_from_abp.py + the fix_*.py chain (checklist in CLAUDE.md)`

   **MODEL/EFFORT for this one (2026-06-09):** highest-stakes script in the repo — use Opus 4.8 at
   HIGH effort. Do NOT hand a data rebuild to Fable 5 (newest ≠ safest for this). The safety is the
   copy-first discipline + the audit gates, not the model. Ready-to-paste prompt for a fresh session:

   ```
   TASK: Rewrite the words-table rebuild so it gets the data right in ONE clean pass,
   instead of the current "wipe everything, then run a long chain of fix_*.py patches to
   repair it." This is refactor backlog #1 / code-health #1. The build is the riskiest
   code in the repo — a bad run silently corrupts hundreds of thousands of word rows.

   BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE, read and absorb:
   - CLAUDE.md → the full "Words rebuild checklist" section (the canonical step order +
     the exact fix_*.py chain and what each one does), the "strongs_base format — CRITICAL
     INVARIANT" section, and the "Do Not" section.
   - memory project_architecture_rework (#2 = this task), project_parser_number_reversal,
     project_bracket_order_fix, project_corpus_audit, project_pronoun_fix_path_c.
   - scripts/build_words_from_abp.py (the builder) and every fix_*.py the checklist names.

   HARD CONSTRAINTS (violating any of these is a failure):
   - COPY-FIRST ALWAYS. All work happens on PythonAnywhere against a COPY:
     `cp bible.db bible_test.db`. NEVER run the rebuild against the live bible.db.
     Never `DELETE FROM words` or `DELETE FROM verses` on the real DB.
   - strongs_base MUST stay fully G/H-prefixed. After any build:
     `SELECT count(*) FROM words WHERE strongs_base GLOB '[0-9]*'` MUST be 0.
   - The single pass must reproduce the SAME end state as today's build+patch chain.
     Some fixes are already folded into the build (the checklist marks which); some are
     intentionally kept as data-patches (e.g. fix_split_merges, lord_oath, kyrios_mistags)
     because doing them globally regresses other verses — DECIDE per fix whether it folds
     into the one pass or must stay a patch, and justify each call.
   - Validate ONLY with the existing read-only audits, at their known baselines:
     health_check.py (≤ minor warnings), audit_bracket_order.py (CHIP genuine ≈ 0),
     audit_corpus_tier1.py (A1 ≈ 176), audit_corpus_tier2.py (~92%),
     scan_strongs_cross.py (FUNCTION-anchor 0), plus tests/test_build_invariants.py and
     test_strongs_join.py. Counts to expect are in the checklist.

   DELIVERABLE ORDER:
   1. A written PLAN first (read-only): which patches fold into the build, which stay as
      data-patches and why, the new single-pass step order, and the before/after validation
      plan. Get it reviewed before touching code.
   2. Only then implement, on bible_test.db, copy-first, validating against the audits at
      each step. Keep a dated rollback copy. Do not deploy or touch the live DB.

   Communication: plain English, no dev jargon (the user is a data-center engineer, not a
   programmer). Show code before changing it. Ask before any large or destructive step.
   ```
2. ~~**Two near-identical "build a word entry" functions on the front end.**~~ **DONE 2026-06-08**
   (commit `007446c`). The three copy-pasted builders now share one core: `entrySnum()` +
   `wordEntryCore()` in static/src/00-core.jsx; makeEntry, flattenAiResults, and the library
   makeEntry each spread the core and add only their own id + extras. No behavior change. Closes
   the frontend half of refactor backlog #3.
3. **More automated checks (mostly done).** The test net now covers broken pages (snapshot harness) and
   the dangerous data invariants (strongs prefix, tipnr type-set, the build's guards). 2026-06-07 added
   the automation layer: GitHub auto-runs the tests + frontend build-check on every push (CI), a
   pre-commit hook runs the same checks locally, `scripts/deploy.sh` is a one-command tested deploy, and
   Dependabot watches outside packages. STILL OPEN here: a nightly `health_check.py` email on PA (needs a
   PA scheduled task + email login) — the only piece that has to run against the real database.
   `code: scripts/health_check.py, scripts/snapshot_endpoints.py, tests/, .github/, scripts/githooks/, scripts/deploy.sh`
4. **Unify the AI prompt STYLE into one shared "house style" snippet.** (The cache-fingerprint half
   of this item is DONE 2026-06-09 — see TODO_ARCHIVE.md. This is the leftover paired half.) CORRECTED 2026-06-09 (see memory project_ai_synthesis_quality): the original plan — drop sentence-count
   caps and let LENGTH FIT THE CONTENT (adaptive) everywhere — is only right for SONNET. Haiku does NOT
   honor a soft adaptive cap: on a maximal chapter (Sibylline Bk 1) it marched every section and overran
   the token ceiling (got chopped mid-word). New rule: share the VOICE only (plain language, short
   one-idea sentences, no run-ons, no jargon, no moralizing) in one core.py snippet; keep LENGTH control
   split by MODEL — HARD sentence-counts on the Haiku prompts, SOFT adaptive (~Nw ceiling) on the Sonnet
   ones. DONE: xref write-up and chapter summary both moved to adaptive length AND onto Sonnet (33742e8;
   b98517f then 5f38d25); the AI-search xref enrichment is on Sonnet too (21aa95a). STILL OPEN: (a) the
   shared VOICE snippet in core.py was never built — xref/chapter carry their own wording; (b) person/place
   (`_PN_SYSTEM`, Haiku, "1-2 sentences") is CORRECT as a hard cap — leave it, do NOT convert to adaptive;
   (c) glance at the LSJ word-study blurb (Haiku) to confirm it's hard-capped, not soft.
   NOTE: changing these prompts is exactly what the
   new fingerprint scheme watches, so each edit will lazily refresh that category's cache (expected).
   `code: shared snippet in core.py; views_crossref.py system prompts; views_metav.py _PN_SYSTEM;
   views_summary.py _SUMMARY_SYSTEM/_*_TMPL; ai.py LSJ prompt in views_lsj.py`

## New features

- ~~**Notes feature.**~~ **DONE 2026-06-09** (notes + highlights + bookmarks + accounts). Study
  notes, color highlights, and bookmarks in the Library (drag-select, or a verse-number menu);
  Notes tab with search + filters + sort + collapsible group-by-book + Export/Import backup.
  Browser-local first, with **opt-in accounts (email/password OR Google) for cross-device sync** —
  the first server-write path, in its own `notes.db` (NOT bible.db). See TODO_ARCHIVE + memory
  `project_notes_highlights`. Open follow-ups: cross-translation highlight paint, word-level
  highlights in KJV/BSB, **password reset / set-password (needs SMTP — see below)**, Apple sign-in (if wanted).

- **Notes — next-session follow-ups (one place to start from).** Memory `project_notes_highlights`
  has the full design + gotchas.
  1. **Email / SMTP on PA — PARKED until the app gets a custom domain (2026-06-09 decision).** Unlocks
     password **reset**, **set-a-password** for Google-only accounts, the nightly `health_check.py`
     email, and later campaigns. Deliberately deferred: a domain means doing the sender setup once,
     properly (mail from `you@domain` + SPF/DKIM via a real service), instead of standing up a throwaway
     Gmail now and redoing it. The send code is provider-agnostic plain SMTP, so when the domain lands
     it's just env vars in the WSGI + a small send helper + the reset/set-password endpoints. Nothing
     else is blocked by it.
  2. ~~**Free-form journal as a SECOND note mode.**~~ **DONE 2026-06-09.** "Verse notes | Journal"
     toggle in the Notes tab; plain-text titled pages, full-page editor that autosaves, ride the same
     store/sync/Export-Import as anchored notes (`kind:"journal"`, no anchor). PLUS copy + "send verse
     to journal" from the reader (drag-select bar AND the verse-number menu) into the page you have
     open. See memory `project_notes_highlights`.
  3. **Highlight paint reach** — cross-translation DONE 2026-06-09 (a highlight now shows in ABP/KJV/BSB;
     exact words in its home text, rounds up to whole verse elsewhere). STILL OPEN (optional, lower
     value): word-level highlights *within* KJV/BSB (today those two only paint a whole verse).
- ~~**BSB (Berean Standard Bible).**~~ **DONE 2026-06-08.** Public-domain modern reading text
  alongside ABP/KJV. Loaded by `scripts/load_bsb.py` into `bsb_verses`; served by `views_bsb.py`
  (`/api/bsb/chapter`). Added as a third reading text in the Library toggle (commit `4c88501`), and
  an eSword-style in-text search box in the Library that searches whichever text you're reading via
  the generic `/api/text-search` (commit `05fe6d5`). No word-level/Strong's data by design.

## Word click-targets — the article wrong-slot cleanup

Background: this is a precision upgrade, **not a bug** — every verse reads correctly. The issue is
purely about which word you land on when you click. Most of this project is already done and live
(see the archive). One sizeable piece is left:

- **Some nouns are "hidden behind" the word "the".** The Greek word for "the" (the commonest word
  in the text) sometimes carries a real noun's English onto its own slot when that noun's slot was
  left empty — so clicking "son" can open the entry for "the" instead of the entry for "son". The
  catch: "the" legitimately renders as lots of English words too, so a blunt fix would wreck good
  data. Any fix has to carefully separate the genuine cases from the leaked ones first, read-only,
  before changing anything. Highest-volume remaining case. `code: audit "the"/G3588 + preposition
  slots whose word is a concrete/proper noun with an empty slot next to it; method in the archive`
- **A small gray-zone leftover** (~90 adjective/particle cases) and a cosmetic possessive split
  ("your rod" — "your" sits on the noun's slot). Low value, not urgent.

---

## Lexicon tab — done; ongoing polish only

Essentially finished. Leave as a small footnote: tweak spacing/hierarchy as you notice rough edges,
nothing structural left. `code: LexiconView in static/src/80-lexicon.jsx; /api/lexicon/* in views_lexicon.py`

## AI search — almost done; ongoing dev

Mostly there. Leave as a footnote: keep refining results quality and the result cards as you use it;
nothing structural blocking. `code: Search tab in static/src/70-search.jsx; /api/search (views_search.py) + /api/ai-search (ai.py); memory project_ai_search_architecture`

> Note: you revisit these on your own schedule — Claude shouldn't keep pitching them as "next steps."

---

## Non-canonical texts — library DONE + LIVE; a few open scraps

The whole non-canonical library is built, loaded, and live: Septuagint Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha,
and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs (all English-only), plus the 14 Apostolic Fathers with
full Greek interlinear. The full build record — pipeline, sources, per-book quirks, the Didache/Enoch
details, and the lessons learned — lives in memory `project_noncanonical_texts` and TODO_ARCHIVE.
Only the genuinely open items are kept below.
- **Possible NEXT** (not started): Book of Jasher (Moses Samuel 1840 — beware the pseudo-Jasher);
  4 Baruch (Paraleipomena Jeremiou); Apocalypse of Zephaniah; Joseph and Aseneth.
- Headings: most books have section headings (harvested from source); the rest could get hand-written
  ones if wanted (later).

**Open: wire non-canonical texts into the Lexicon + Search tabs.**
The word panel already shows an "In the Didache" count, but it isn't clickable and the Lexicon/Search
tabs only know the Bible corpus. To let people browse every Didache (or future-book) verse where a
word appears, teach those tabs about the `<book>_words` tables — best done once, generically, as a
"non-canonical corpus" option rather than per book.
`code: views_lexicon.py + LexiconView (80-lexicon.jsx); views_search.py + Search (70-search.jsx)`

### KNOWN GAP — Hebrew/Aramaic interlinear for a non-canonical text

The extra-text **interlinear** is hard-wired to Greek: the endpoint joins `lexicon` on a G-number
(`l.strongs_g = w.strongs`), and the reader's word click routes to LSJ. English-only loads are
language-agnostic (Enoch's source is Ge'ez and it loaded fine — we only store English + headings),
so the source language ONLY matters if we want a word-by-word original. For a Hebrew interlinear
(e.g. Ben Sira/Sirach, which has real Hebrew; or Jubilees' Qumran Hebrew fragments) we'd need: BDB
join on H-numbers in `/api/extra`, BDB/Hebrew routing + right-to-left chips in the reader. Not urgent
— no Hebrew non-canonical is queued, and any of them can ship English-only today.

## Bigger features (someday / ideas)

### Advanced desktop workspace
An opt-in multi-panel layout for wide screens (mobile and normal desktop stay exactly as they are).
Picture: book list on the left, the reading text in the middle, and a right column split into
cross-refs/search/notes on top and the word study (LSJ/BDB/MetaV) on the bottom — all live, no
pop-ups, with draggable dividers that remember their sizes. Full mockup and panel-by-panel spec
kept below.

<details><summary>Full workspace spec</summary>

**Three modes:** Mobile (unchanged) · Desktop basic (unchanged, default) · Desktop advanced
(opt-in toggle in the header, only above ~1100px wide, resizable panels).

```
┌─────────┬──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│ Books   │                          │  Cross-refs / Search / │

└─────────┴──────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

- **Left — book/chapter navigator:** always-visible book list (replaces the dropdown); click a book
  to expand its chapters inline (one open at a time); collapsible to reclaim width; on mobile stays
  the current dropdown.
- **Center — Library:** ABP/KJV/Parallel toggle and all current chip/interlinear controls. Word
  click updates the word-study panel in place; verse-number click opens cross-refs in the top-right.
  Chip mode and prose mode (dense, eSword-style inline Strong's superscripts). Parallel mode auto-
  collapses the left nav for width.
- **Top-right — tabs:** Cross-refs (the current TSK panel, today a pop-up) · Search (lexicon + AI
  combined) · Notes (per-verse study notes — future, needs a `notes` table). Default tab: Cross-refs.
- **Bottom-right — word study:** always live, updates on word click; LSJ/BDB/MetaV; replaces the
  pop-up sidebar in this mode.
- **Resizing:** draggable dividers between all panels; sizes saved in the browser.
- **Toggle:** header button switches basic/advanced, remembered in the browser, only shown on wide screens.
</details>

### Highlighting + notes (Logos-style) — DONE 2026-06-09, two paint follow-ups open
Notes + highlights + bookmarks LIVE, plus opt-in accounts/sync (see archive + memory
`project_notes_highlights`). Non-canon notes, Notes-tab filters/sort/group, Export/Import all DONE.
Still open:
- **Cross-translation paint** — a highlight made in ABP doesn't show in KJV/BSB (word positions
  differ per text). Today paint is matched to the text it was made in.
- **Word-level highlights in KJV/BSB** — they anchor at the whole verse for now (no `data-note-pos`).

### Free user accounts — MOSTLY DONE 2026-06-09 (reset pending)
LIVE: email/password + Google sign-in, opt-in, syncing notes across devices via `notes.db`
(see archive + memory). App stays fully usable with no account. STILL OPEN:
- **Password reset + set-password** — needs the site to SEND email (SMTP on PA, not configured). A
  Google-only account currently can't use the password form (no password set). Same SMTP blocker as
  the nightly health_check email below — wire SMTP once, both unlock.
- **Apple sign-in** — only if wanted (needs a paid Apple Developer account; heavier than Google).
- Email campaign / reading plans (the original "reach" payoff) — once SMTP + accounts are proven.

### Broader AI search — meaning-based passage search
Logos feels "broader" for two reasons: it reads their whole paid library (commentaries, dictionaries),
and it blends exact-word search with meaning-based search. We deliberately stay text-first (bible +
lexicons only), so we won't copy the library part. But we *can* add meaning-based search over the bible
text itself — find verses that are *about* a concept even when they don't use the word — which gives the
"broad" feel while staying inside scripture. `code: Search tab + /api/search; would need a concept index`

### Topic browser
Browse by concept (Atonement, Covenant, Resurrection, Holy Spirit…) as an alternative to AI search —
a good starting point when you don't know what to search. Use an existing topic list only for the
category *names* (renamed to drop loaded framing); generate the actual verses and summaries ourselves,
Berean-style. Build a quick proof-of-concept with the off-the-shelf topic→verse mappings first to see
if people use it, then swap in our own verse selection. Could be a new tab or a mode inside Search.

### Map tab
Biblical geography as its own tab. Three angles: follow the current chapter and show its places;
search a place and pin every verse that mentions it; or a free-explore world map where clicking a
city opens the MetaV sidebar. The neat version ties maps to the text (e.g. plot every place in Paul's
letters across his journeys) — nobody does this well. Coordinates and the map library are already in
place for the existing place sidebar, so this is smaller than it looks.

### More texts + word grammar (morphology)
- **Word grammar everywhere:** show part-of-speech/tense/case in plain English for every word, from
  free scholarly datasets (CATSS for Greek OT, macula-greek for NT, morphhb/macula-hebrew for Hebrew).
  Some of this already shows for ABP Greek; this would extend coverage. `code: morph column on words`
- **Textus Receptus Greek NT:** add as a second NT text next to ABP. Same Strong's numbering, so it
  plugs in easily, and showing where the two Greek texts differ is genuinely rare and useful.
- **More English translations** (ASV, YLT, Darby, Geneva) as comparison texts — all public domain.
  (ESV is likely licensed — check before importing.)
- **Extra-biblical texts** referenced in scripture (1 Enoch, cited in Jude; Dead Sea Scrolls variants)
  as a separate "Apocrypha" section, never mixed into the canon. Research good digital sources first.

### Dead Sea Scrolls — wanted, but the hardest one (why it's still not done)
Deliberately skipped so far, not an oversight. The blockers are real:
- **No public-domain English exists.** The readable translations everyone cites (Vermes,
  Wise-Abegg-Cook, García Martínez) are all modern and copyrighted — nothing free to drop in the way
  Charles/Lightfoot/Brenton were. What IS free is photos + academic transcriptions (Leon Levy digital
  library), not a ready-to-read English text.
- **The scrolls are mostly Hebrew/Aramaic fragments** — broken, gap-ridden, not a clean verse-by-verse
  book. And our interlinear is wired for Greek (G-numbers); a Hebrew original-language view needs the
  BDB / H-number / right-to-left plumbing flagged as the known gap above.
- **The realistic angle isn't "another book to read" — it's a compare view.** The Great Isaiah Scroll
  (1QIsaa) is complete and famous, and its value is showing WHERE it differs from the standard Hebrew
  (Masoretic) text. That's a side-by-side "variants vs the MT" feature, bigger and different from the
  apocrypha plumbing. Best first step if/when we tackle it. `code: would need a clean PD/licensed
  transcription + a verse-aligned variant layer, not the load_extra path`
