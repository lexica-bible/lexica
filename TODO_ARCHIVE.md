# TODO — Archive (finished & scrapped work)

History and "don't redo this" notes. Nothing here is open. Deep detail lives in the
memory files; this is the plain-English record plus the rollback database names and the
few "leave it alone" verdicts worth keeping.

## AI result cache — unified prompt-fingerprint scheme — DONE 2026-06-09

The four Haiku-backed caches (AI search, reading summaries, TSK cross-refs, person/place blurbs) all
live in the one `ai_search_cache` table but each versioned itself differently: search hashed its own
prompt (good — edit the prompt, the cache auto-refreshes), but summaries used a hand-bumped number you
had to remember to change, and the cross-ref + person/place caches never refreshed on a prompt edit at
all. Fixed: every cache now tags its rows `category:hash-of-its-own-prompt`. Edit any prompt and only
that cache refreshes, lazily, with no manual bump.

- One shared set of helpers in `core.py` (`ai_fingerprint`, `ai_cache_get/put`, `ai_cache_prune`,
  plus a one-time `ai_cache_drop_legacy` sweep). Each cache prunes only its OWN stale rows at startup.
- **The landmine, handled:** search's old startup cleanup deleted every other cache's rows except the
  ones it spared by name. Switching the other caches to the new tag would have made that delete wipe
  them. It's now scoped to search's own rows only. Proven with a focused test (search prune leaves the
  others untouched, and each cache prunes only its own).
- **Per-book authors (the user's call):** a summary's row key stays stable, the author goes only in the
  tag — so editing one book's author refreshes just that book, while editing the prompt wording refreshes
  all summaries.
- LSJ was deliberately left out — it stores its summaries in the lexicon tables, not this cache table.
- One-time cost: the first run after deploy clears the old-format rows, so everything cached before
  regenerates once on next view. Unavoidable when changing the tagging scheme.
- Verified locally without touching the real database: logic test on a throwaway copy + a full app boot
  against a copy of the database (startup cleanup ran clean). Closes refactor backlog #4's cache half;
  the paired prompt-STYLE cleanup is still open in TODO.md.

## Word click-targets ("dual-ordering") — mostly done

The goal: when one slot bundled several English words, give each its own clickable chip while
keeping both the Greek order (chip view) and the English reading order (prose view) correct.
Again — never a reading bug, just click precision. The mechanism is proven and the bulk shipped:

- **"the LORD" + verb** — split so "the LORD" is its own chip. 795 spots fixed, live 2026-06-05.
  Rollback: `bible_pre_lordsubj_20260605.db`. `script: fix_lord_subject.py`
- **Nouns stuck on a function word** — moved the noun's English back onto its own empty slot.
  Done in three rounds (everyday nouns, then idioms, then plurals/in-bracket cases), 108 fixes
  total, live 2026-06-06. Rollbacks: `bible_pre_funcword_20260606.db`,
  `bible_pre_funcword_idioms_20260606.db`. `script: fix_funcword_subject.py`
- **Scrapped:** a third case (a verb's English wrapping around its subject) — too few, too varied,
  and would need risky row inserts for tiny payoff. Parked for good.

What's left is in the live TODO (the "the"/article cleanup). The proven method if anyone resumes:
always start read-only and measure first; copy the database before any real change; never run a
blanket delete; keep repair scripts narrow, re-runnable, with a dry-run; and add them to the
checklist in CLAUDE.md.

## Non-canonical library — built and live (2026-06-07)

A whole shelf of extra texts now lives in the Library under the "Other" menu, walled off from Bible
search and word counts (ABP stays the anchor). All English-only unless noted:
- **Septuagint Apocrypha** (16 books, Brenton 1851).
- **Pseudepigrapha** — 1-2 Enoch, Jubilees, 2-3 Baruch, Apocalypse of Abraham, Assumption of Moses,
  2 Esdras/4 Ezra, Life of Adam and Eve, Psalms of Solomon, Letter of Aristeas, Ascension of Isaiah,
  Sibylline Oracles (mostly R.H. Charles; sources per-book in memory).
- **Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs** (12 separate books, Charles).
- **Apostolic Fathers** (14, incl. Didache) — these have the **full Greek interlinear**, same
  word-study layer as the Bible: Brannan/Lake Greek → Strong's (openscriptures + Dodson glosses) →
  Lightfoot English. Polycarp ch 10-14 survive only in Latin → English-only there.

How it's built (generic, re-runnable): each text gets its own two tables `<book>_words` /
`<book>_verses`, served by `/api/extra/<book>/chapter/<n>`, loaded by `scripts/load_extra.py`. Adding
a future text = tag it, drop two json files, add one line to `NONCANON`, load. `englishOnly:true`
locks the reader to Prose for texts with no original-language tagging. The full pipeline, source URLs,
and per-book parsing quirks are in memory `project_noncanonical_texts`. Still open (in the live TODO):
more books (Jasher, 4 Baruch…), optional hand-written headings, wiring these into the Lexicon/Search
tabs, and the Hebrew-interlinear gap.

## Search results now match the Library look — done

The AI search result verses were restyled to match the polished Library reading view: plain word
chips in reading order, no Strong's clutter, brackets kept, gold highlights kept (same as Library's
chip mode). Also stopped re-fetching each verse's words one at a time — the search response now
carries the words the server already built. `code: Search results in static/src/70-search.jsx`

---

## Lexicon tab — finished (ongoing polish only)

The word-study flow (search → word profile → gloss chips → book distribution → verse list) is done
and reads cleanly, matched to the Library look. Anything left is minor spacing/hierarchy polish done
as noticed — nothing structural. `code: LexiconView in static/src/80-lexicon.jsx`

## Full corpus audit — done, corpus is sound (2026-06-05)

Checked all ~624k words against independent reference texts. **Verdict: the corpus is sound.**
- Internal consistency check: zero of the pronoun-class corruption that bit us before.
- External agreement: ~92% match against the reference Greek texts. The other 8% is *not* error —
  it's genuine edition/translation differences and proper-noun number quirks. **100% is the wrong
  target** (it would mean rewriting our text into theirs) — don't chase it.
- One real issue found and fixed: 1,724 pronoun slots labeled with the wrong person, corrected.
  Rollback: `bible_pre_g1473gloss_20260605.db`. `script: fix_g1473_gloss.py`
- A residual ~1,069 cases are blocked on missing grammar data — not chased, not worth guessing.
- Audit scripts are read-only and in the rebuild checklist. `scripts: audit_corpus_tier1/2.py`

## Word-order garble fixes — done (2026-06-05)

A rebuild had left some multi-word phrases reading backwards or bundled wrong.
- **"this/that of X" over-reach** — fixed; 3,438 verses corrected. Rollback:
  `bible_pre_splitfix_20260604.db`.
- **Bracketed phrases reading scrambled** — fixed; 374 → 0. (Memory: project_bracket_order_fix.)
- **Hab 3:14 showed up twice** — root cause was a duplicated line in the source text file; removed
  at source and cleaned the live database. `script: fix_hab314_dupes.py`
- **Punctuation on the wrong word** — fixed (365 verses). `script: fix_bracket_punct.py`
- Known harmless false alarms in the old audit tools (~8 twin-bracket flags) — database is correct,
  **don't re-chase them.**

---

## Lexicon coverage for pronouns — done (2026-06-04)

Made sure pronoun forms (this/that/who/me/you in all their endings) resolve to a real dictionary
entry instead of a terse fallback. Found the big paradigms already resolve fine; added a handful of
small redirect stubs for the few genuine gaps. Rollback for the stubs is a one-line delete (in the
memory note). Reopen only if a specific word is reported showing the terse gloss.

---

## Text structure — done

- **Section headings** added across the whole canon (2,431 of them), shown in chip/prose/parallel.
  (Song of Solomon has none — the source doesn't carry them; not a bug.)
- **Prose reading mode** — normal books flow as paragraphs with small verse numbers; poetry keeps
  one line per verse.
- **Font size control** — A−/A+ buttons, remembered in the browser.

---

## Pronoun number fix + grammar display — done (2026-06-04)

Live as rebuild #6. Rollback: `bible_pre_morph_20260604.db`. (Memory: project_pronoun_fix_path_c.)
- Added word-grammar data (part of speech, tense, case…) covering ~78% of words.
- Fixed "he is a prophet" word order (Gen 20:7) and a couple of related ordering cases.
- Word grammar now shows in plain English in the word pop-up for ABP Greek (e.g. "Verb · Aorist ·
  Active · Indicative · 3rd person · Singular").

---

## MetaV (people & places) — done

- People sidebar (bio, family, genealogy) and places sidebar (map + coordinates), with proper-noun
  clicks routed correctly in both ABP and KJV.
- Hebrew names route to the people/places view with the Hebrew dictionary stacked below; clans
  (the "-ites") are labeled "People / Clan". When a name has no data, a short AI blurb fills in
  (text-first, cached).
