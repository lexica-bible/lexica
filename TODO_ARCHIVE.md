# TODO — Archive (finished & scrapped work)

History and "don't redo this" notes. Nothing here is open. Deep detail lives in the
memory files; this is the plain-English record plus the rollback database names and the
few "leave it alone" verdicts worth keeping.

## SEO / search discoverability — DONE 2026-06-16

The site was invisible to Google: the React app served an empty shell with no per-passage URLs, and
there were no icons/share data. Built the whole discoverability layer (memories `project_seo_pages` +
`project_seo_branding`):
- **Branding:** favicons (svg/ico/apple-touch/192/512) + a 1200×630 `og.png` share card, generated from
  one logo by `scripts/gen-icons.js`; meta/description/OG/Twitter tags; `robots.txt`. Icons/share live
  in `static/`; `app.py` serves the root paths crawlers fetch.
- **Crawlable pages (`views_seo.py` + `templates/seo/`):** `/read/...` chapter/book pages (ABP/KJV/BSB/
  Hebrew interlinear, brackets + red Greek-order numbers) + `/word/<strongs>` word-study pages +
  generated `/sitemap.xml` (~18-19k URLs). Public-domain texts ONLY. App deep-links in via `/?b=&c=&t=`
  and `/?lex=` (read on mount in 90-app.jsx). Phases 1a/1b/2/3 all shipped (commits 09eead5 → 00f7207).
- **Google Search Console:** Domain property `lexica.bible`, Cloudflare-verified, sitemap submitted
  (Domain props need the FULL sitemap URL). Discovered ~4,561 pages immediately.

Lessons worth keeping:
- **og:image must be a real PNG, not an SVG** — most link-preview scrapers won't render SVG.
- **Center a lockup by measure-then-crop, not hand-placed coordinates** — guessing text widths put the
  share card off-center twice; rendering the art, auto-cropping the ink, and compositing centered fixed it.
- **ABP brackets ≠ italics** — they're distinct ABP notation (a `bracket_id` group drawn `[ ]` in Greek
  order with position numbers), NOT the italic helper-word styling. Don't conflate them.
- **Interlinear chips must reserve all three rows** (lemma/english/strongs, invisible placeholder when a
  row is empty) or function words push their English up into the original-language line.
- **Can't test the SEO pages locally** (no bible.db on the dev box, must not create one) — verified by
  py_compile + standalone Jinja parse, then deploy-tested. Worked fine.

## Docs slimmed — CLAUDE.md → standing rules + pointers — DONE 2026-06-16

Restructured the always-loaded docs so the rules that matter stand out instead of drowning in a
changelog. CLAUDE.md 908 → 599 lines:
- The ~90-line Words rebuild checklist moved to a slash command, `.claude/commands/rebuild-words.md`
  (`/rebuild-words`) — it only matters when actually rebuilding; CLAUDE.md keeps a 6-line pointer.
- Library Tab section (~294 lines of dated UI changelog, already mirrored in the project_* memories)
  condensed to ~100 lines of standing rules + memory pointers.
- Deployment + AI-cache sections trimmed to the operational facts (where secrets/tokens live, which
  db holds what, the gates, the cache scheme + LANDMINE); dated "done/live" setup history dropped (it
  was already in this archive + memory). Stale "BibleHub scrape — status" block retired.
- Commits 422ff46 / 07bf65b / 868709d, pushed.

Memory tidied the same way: the index (MEMORY.md) went 20.5 → 13.9 KB (long lines → one-line hooks;
fixed the stale "next up: sepia+dark / refactor #1" line); the 63 topic files left intact — they're
the detail CLAUDE.md now points at. New preference saved: memory `feedback_lean_claude_md` (keep
CLAUDE.md lean — heavy procedures → slash commands, done/live history → memory + TODO_ARCHIVE).

## Two-ending adjective gender (Masculine/Feminine) — FIXED, route a, LIVE 2026-06-16

Greek two-ending adjectives (ἀόρατος, ον) share ONE form for masculine and feminine; the OT (CATSS) and
NT (Robinson) morph sources often just DEFAULT such a word to Masculine, so the word-study card read the
wrong gender next to a feminine noun (Gen 1:2 "earth, unseen": γῆ feminine, ἀόρατος showed Masculine). NOT
a display bug — `decodeMorph` faithfully shows the single gender letter the source gave. FIXED via route
(a): for a two-ending adjective the source NEVER tags Feminine (so it has never shown it can tell them
apart), the card now shows **"Masculine/Feminine"**; words the source DOES resolve, plus all Feminine/Neuter
tags, are left alone (decided per testament). ~836 displays (OT 441 / NT 395). The two-ending signal = the
LSJ headword endings (three-ending lists a feminine ending then a neuter — ἀγαθός → ή, όν; two-ending lists
only the neuter — ἀγαθοποιός → όν). Generator `scripts/build_two_ending.py` → `static/src/00b-two-ending.jsx`
(`TWO_END_SOFT_OT/_NT` sets) + a tweak to `decodeMorph` in 00-core.jsx; commits fbd22cc + 2e874e2.
**Re-run the generator after any words rebuild** (genders/tallies shift) and rebuild app.js.

LESSONS: (1) measure-first paid off — the source turned out INCONSISTENT (resolves some two-ending words,
defaults others), which is exactly why the never-Feminine rule is right and a blanket "blur every masculine"
would be wrong (it'd also expose detector slips like εἷς, which the never-F rule auto-excludes). (2) Matching
our words to LSJ by lemma needs BOTH the hyphen (ἀδικ-ητικός) AND the final sigma ς folded, or ~96% miss —
cost two bad runs before the numbers were real.

DEFERRED — route (b): resolve to a REAL gender from the neighboring noun (match the same-verse noun by
case+number, which is reliably tagged; only gender is the unknown). Safe only when there's exactly one clear
match, else fall back to "Masculine/Feminine"; needs the neighboring words at display time (the card sees
only the clicked word now) or a precompute pass. Parked, not rejected. Memory `project_two_ending_gender`.

## ABP variant-reading (Bos/CP/Ald/Six) footnotes — INVESTIGATED + proof built + SCRAPPED 2026-06-16

ABP's own dagger apparatus ("CP reads X", "see Bos for variants"). The data IS in the free ABP 2nd-ed
PDF (archive.org `apostolic-bible`), but the PDF has **no verse anchors**: footnotes pool at each page
BOTTOM with their text only; the verse numbers + the daggers that tie a note to its word are in a custom
font that extracts as NOTHING. So a note pins only to its PAGE (~15-24 verses); the verse is INFERRED from
the English gloss (distinctive word = nailed, e.g. "dimness"→Gen 15:12; a common word over a wide span =
a guess). No digital module carries it either — BibleHub/studybible.info bare; the e-Sword/MySword ABP
modules (incl. the user's local SQLitePlus-encrypted `abp+.bblx`) are text-only, no `<RF>` footnotes
(verified by opening them). PDF English decodes via a fixed +29 letter-shift; each variant's Greek is a
SEPARATE garbled font, so only the English meaning is recoverable. A 5-note Isaiah proof shipped († on the
verse → folded into the TSK cross-ref card) then was fully REMOVED. **VERDICT (user): niche + lossy —
"bereans don't need this; it's nothing you can't find by digging into the Hebrew/Greek."** Path B (diff
the printed Greek editions vs ABP ourselves) also rejected (same hard alignment as Rahlfs; would be our
apparatus, not ABP's). KEPT from the session: verse#/Strong's# now scale with the reading font (CLAUDE.md).
DON'T re-pitch. Memory `project_pending_improvements`.

## ABP surface romanization (translit) — DONE + SHIPPED 2026-06-15

The ABP "in this verse" side-card form now carries a romanization (Hebrew/BSB already did) — the parked
follow-up from the inflected-form section below. `scripts/build_abp_translit.py` fills `abp_surface.translit`
(348,935 forms, read-only) with a Greek→Latin romanization matched to the lexicon's OWN SBL headword style
(confirmed by sampling `lexicon.translit` — theós / pneûma / archḗ / huiós): keeps accents, eta→ē / omega→ō,
ch/th/ph, **rough breathing → "h" read from the dictionary form** (the bh surface forms carry no breathing),
**initial rho → rh**, and upsilon y-vs-u (y standalone, u in a diphthong incl. υι). Tested on real words before
filling. NOT the throwaway ~40-line map the earlier note warned against — it handles the long tail (breathings,
iota subscript, diphthongs, gamma-nasal, final sigma) and matches the app's existing romanization, so it's safe
under the accuracy brand. Re-run after any position-shifting words/abp_surface rebuild (next to build_abp_surface).
LESSON kept: the empty-string-in-string trap — `'' in 'αεηο'` is True, so word-initial upsilon silently became
'u'; use SETS for membership. Commits d9adc7a (script) + 4e73577 (upsilon fix). Memory `project_bsb_words`.

## ABP morphology gap — INVESTIGATED + SCRAPPED 2026-06-15

Looked hard at filling the ~22% of ABP words with no morph (135,774). Verdict: not worth it; don't re-investigate.
Measured on PA, the gap breaks down: 32,473 proper names (ABP doesn't parse them — correct), ~32,922
indeclinable / no-surface-form words (καί / ἐν / the article etc. — nothing to parse, correctly blank), and only
~70,379 inflected content words that genuinely could be filled (~86% OT). The single ABP-keyed source for those
is Van der Pool's **Analytical Lexicon** — a paid $5 426-page PDF (an extraction project), whose parses also carry
real nominative/accusative + gender ambiguity with no clean tiebreak. For a side-panel detail aimed at non-Greek
readers, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. Also checked **STEPBible's ABGk/abpgrk** (Tyndale's adaptation): it's
the SAME ABP text, not an upgrade — single-dot accent + no breathing (like what we already have), no inline
morphology, under Van der Pool's "all rights reserved" copyright (NOT the CC-BY that covers STEPBible's own
TAGNT/TAGOT). The free CC-BY TAGOT is Rahlfs-based, so it can't reach ABP's Vaticanus-Sixtine-only OT words anyway.
Full record: memory `project_abp_morph_gap`.

## ABP inflected-form side-card line — DONE + LIVE 2026-06-15 (Hebrew + BSB + ABP; KJV impossible)

The click-a-word side card shows the printed in-context Greek/Hebrew form on a small line under the dictionary
lemma. Hebrew (heb_words pointed word) + BSB (bsb_words form/form_translit) were easy. ABP was the hard one
(3 of 4; KJV can't — English↔Strong's, no original word). The ABP trail, lessons worth keeping:
- ABP's own source is English+Strong's only — no Greek surface words. So the printed form is ALIGNED in by
  Strong's and stored in a SEPARATE read-only table `abp_surface(verse_id, position, form, translit)`
  (`scripts/build_abp_surface.py`, never touches words/verses; served by /api/chapter's deploy-safe LEFT JOIN).
- FIRST built off Rahlfs-1935 (OT) / TAGNT (NT) → capped at OT 75% / NT 84%. The user spotted WHY, and it's the
  lesson: **ABP's OT is the Vaticanus-Sixtine text family; Rahlfs is an eclectic edition. Where the two Greek OTs
  disagree the Strong's match fails — a STRUCTURAL cap, no Rahlfs-based source can close it against ABP.**
- FIX: ABP's OWN printed Greek, already on PA — `bh_scrape.db` `bh_words.greek` (the BibleHub ABP scrape). Same
  text as our words → 91% found. Builder `--bh` expands bh compound cells (`4160-3588-2316`/`εποίησεν ο θεός`)
  and bridges ABP's raw G1473 pronoun mis-tag to the live corrected numbers before aligning.
- bh's Greek is ACCENT-ONLY (no breathing marks): an accent-only inflection (dative `αρχή`) looks like the
  breathing-marked lemma (`ἀρχή`) → would echo a useless line on ~every word. `strip_marks` only keeps a form
  that differs from the lemma by ENDING → 56% of words show a line; the rest ABP prints = the dictionary word.
  Shown forms are breathing-less = ABP-authentic (user chose authentic over Rahlfs-polished, knowingly).
- The Rahlfs/TAGNT path stays in the builder as an alt source. Surface translit is now DONE (the section above,
  `build_abp_translit.py`); a full parsed-LXX 2nd parallel text stays a PARKED follow-up (in TODO.md). Re-run
  `build_abp_surface.py --bh` THEN `build_abp_translit.py` after any words rebuild that shifts positions. Full
  record: memory `project_bsb_words`. Commits f536c52 (Rahlfs first cut) → 0b5e5ae + 0b908b7 (bh).

## Front-end split — LibraryView render block out to 59c — DONE 2026-06-14

Closed TODO #3 ("split the oversized front-end file"). `static/src/60-library.jsx` had grown to 3,369
lines; split in two passes.
- PREAMBLE (earlier 2026-06-14): self-contained code before the `LibraryView` component →
  `59a-library-helpers.jsx` + `59b-library-nav.jsx`. Behavior-neutral — app.js unchanged except 3
  header comments (the moved code was top-level and used nothing from LibraryView).
- RENDER BLOCK (this session): the ~600-line verse-renderer family (renderVerse + its chip/bracket
  inner helpers, renderProseWords, KJV, BSB/plain, Hebrew, flow, Didache/non-canon) → a new
  `59c-library-render.jsx`, the `LibRender` IIFE module. Each renderer takes a `ctx` bundle of the 19
  live values it needs from LibraryView (book/chapter; note/highlight helpers hiClass / vnumEl /
  noteMarker / noteVnum / noteDotInline / vnumNoteHandlers; toggles wordMode / showInterlinear /
  showStrongs; onWordClick / handleVerseNum; refs highlightRef / vnumPressRef; selBook / nav / corpus /
  nonCanon / didVerses). LibraryView builds ctx once per render and binds 13 thin one-line wrappers, so
  every call site in the 540-line return reads UNCHANGED — the only new code is the ctx object + 13
  wrappers. 60-library.jsx: 3,369 → 1,918 lines. Commit 547c483, pushed; user spot-checked live
  (ABP chip+prose, KJV, BSB, Hebrew, Didache, Compare — all good).

Why wrappers / not byte-identical: unlike the preamble (top-level move, app.js unchanged), this changed
call sites (`renderVerse(v)` → wrapper), so the "app.js unchanged" proof didn't apply. Verified instead
by clean build + `node --check`, an audit that every ctx field is destructured in each function that uses
it with no LibraryView-local leaked through, 13 wrappers present + old defs gone, and a deterministic
rebuild.

LESSON — line endings (cost ~30 min): the repo's `static/src/*.jsx` are NOT all CRLF (the old CLAUDE.md /
memory claim). They're MIXED — 60-library.jsx is LF, others (59a/59b, 10-icons, 30-detail-panel,
59-dayintro) CRLF. I wrote the new/changed files CRLF on that assumption, flipping 60-library LF→CRLF
(whole-file diff); fixed by converting both to LF to match HEAD. app.js legitimately carries 4 CRLF from
CRLF sources' block comments. RULE: match a file's existing endings, don't flip a whole file; check with
`xxd`/byte-count, NOT Git-for-Windows `grep`/piped `git show` (both falsely called the LF 60-library
"CRLF"). Docs corrected: CLAUDE.md + memory project_frontend_build_step / project_code_quality.

## Library AI synthesis — framing-over-prohibition pass — DONE 2026-06-14

Killed three output leaks in the Library's AI writers WITHOUT adding "don't say X" rules — the
user's explicit ask. All three traced to the same mistake: a blacklist/command bolted on, fighting
the frame. Fixed the FRAME + the worked EXAMPLE instead. Full record: memory `project_ai_synthesis_quality`
("Framing over prohibition"). Backend `.py` only, no app.js rebuild; user deploys (his step), reviewing live.
- **LSJ word definition (views_lsj.py)** — was still citing Homer/Iliad despite a "don't reference
  Homer/Plato/Attic" blacklist (we feed it a classical lexicon entry, then forbid echoing it — the
  blacklist loses, and naming Homer primes it). Reframed: audience = someone *reading the Greek Bible*,
  the entry = "source material to distill"; dropped the blacklist. Also fixed the user's self-reference
  catch (it re-announced the headword / defined in a circle) via "the reader is already looking at the
  word + its translation; pick up from there." Pulled the two asks into constants + added `_LSJ_SYNTH_VER`
  → LSJ now **fingerprint-self-heals** (a `_synth_ver` stamp in summary_json), so a prompt edit
  auto-refreshes; the old `clear_parse_jargon_cache.py` is no longer needed for prompt changes.
- **Chapter summary (views_summary.py)** — "Moses wrote/records…" opened every Pentateuch chapter
  because the author line was injected into the chapter prompt (+ "use the author's name"). Fix = SCOPE:
  the author now feeds ONLY the book blurb; the chapter prompt just says what happens, so Moses is named
  only where the text puts him. Auto-refreshes via the existing summary fingerprint.
- **TSK xref synthesis (views_crossref.py)** — self-referenced "related passages" + "thematic/the thread",
  because the worked EXAMPLE itself modeled it ("Later passages keep returning…", "The thread is…"). The
  example beat the rule. Rewrote the example to name specifics ("Running through all of it is…"), reframed
  to "write from inside the text… name a specific passage when it carries the point," dropped the quoted
  blacklist. Auto-refreshes via `_XREF_VER`.

OPEN backstop (only if LSJ still cites Homer once live): strip the obvious classical author names out of
the entry text before the model sees it — no rule, just don't feed it. Left for a follow-up thread.

## Days month-grouping + mobile sticky header + intro/overview mobile header — DONE 2026-06-14

Small polish round, all live/pushed. Full record: memory `project_chronological_tab` "SESSION 2026-06-14".
- **Days list = ~12 collapsible MONTH blocks** (58-dayplan.jsx) — 365 rows was too long to scroll.
  Accordion, one month open at a time, auto-opens to the month you're reading. `monthSize = ceil(total/12)`.
- **Mobile Days progress header is now STICKY** (was `position:static` after an earlier bleed-through
  attempt) — pulled to the sheet edges so it's a solid full-width bar, no rows peek beside/above it.
- **Mobile intro card + overview popup header = compact `‹` chevron** inline with the title (not the
  wide "‹ Overview"/"‹ Intro" text), ✕ dropped from both (handle + tap-outside close them), title
  auto-shrinks to one line via the NEW `useFitText` hook (20-shared-components.jsx; `useLayoutEffect`
  added to 00-core). The painful path here (stacked-above, reserved-gutter — both rejected) is the
  lesson in memory `feedback_ui_iteration`: on a fussy visual tweak, shrink the control, don't relayout.
- **More popout + Compare dropdown swallow their dismiss click** (capture-phase one-shot, like the Aa
  menu) so the outside click that closes them doesn't also hit a word chip behind.
- **Search popup mode toggle (Any/All/Phrase) → underline tabs** (was a filled box), mirroring the
  source picker.

## Chronological views cleanup — rail design language — DONE 2026-06-14

Gave the chronological views the same look as the detail-rail pass. All live (user deployed as we
went). Full record: memory `project_chronological_tab` "CHRONOLOGICAL VIEWS CLEANUP" + `project_side_panel_rail`.
- **In-reader chapter marker** (`.lib-chrono-chapmark`, reader + Compare): gold → navy; spacing 16/9 →
  28px top / 5px bottom (heading hugs what it labels).
- **Days plan rebuilt:** dropped the per-row left check, the gold "Today" highlight, the navy "Reading"
  tint, and the open/collapse caret. One marker on the RIGHT — navy ✓ (read, click to undo) / navy dot
  (the day you're reading); clickable only on the day you're on (un-mark a prior day = select it first).
  One-click on a day = collapse the open day + open this + move the dot + load its first reading. Navy
  backbone spine (pseudo-element on a full-height inner wrapper, not a border on the scroll box — the
  border only spanned the visible rows) + a GOLD sub-rib on the open day's passages. Active passage =
  just bold. "Jump to today" selects today too.
- **Eras picker** matched Days: navy spine + gold sub-rib on the open era, de-boxed headers, no caret.
- **Mobile Days:** tap-a-day = same select behavior but the sheet STAYS open (a separate
  non-closing `onPickPassage`); NO spine; bigger rows/text; progress header `position:static` (sticky
  pinned below the scroll padding and rows bled through the gap). A mobile-Eras restyle was TRIED then
  REVERTED — user said Eras-on-mobile is fine, only Days needed work.
- **Reading-intro "Today's passages" + metaV "Nave's" rows:** dropped per-item boxes → plain hover rows.
- **Word/xref back-link follows the rail base:** "‹ Intro" over the chrono day-intro, "‹ Overview"
  otherwise (LibraryView `detailBase` → App `backLabel`).
- **Source picker + Eras/Days toggle → underline tabs.** The source row is a 4-equal-column GRID so the
  active "More" label (HEB/ESV/a book name) can't change a tab's width and shove ABP/KJV/BSB — the real
  "resize" bug (the inline-flex `.seg` was content-sized; flex:1 1 0 didn't equalize). A FIXED-height
  popout was tried for the menu first and REVERTED — the user only wanted the BUTTON to stop resizing.
- **More menu → floating popout** (anchored under the source row; ESV/NIV/Hebrew under a default-open
  "Bibles" group). Both the More popout and the Compare ▾ menu close on click-outside / Esc (document
  listener; replaced Compare's old z-90 scrim that sat under the toolbar). Picking a row text closes More.

## Book-summary author list — added scribes; metaV fold-in TRIED then REVERTED — 2026-06-13

The reading-pane book blurb names the writer from `_BOOK_AUTHORS` (views_summary.py), which lists
only well-established authors and leaves the anonymous books blank. SHIPPED: the two scribes that the
text itself names — Jeremiah/Baruch (Jer 36) and Romans/Tertius (Rom 16:22), added inline to the
value. Those render cleanly (Jeremiah's blurb opens "Jeremiah… dictated this book to his scribe
Baruch"). That's the only lasting change.

TRIED AND BACKED OUT: folding metaV's **Writers** list (gusheng/MetaV — same dataset as People/Places)
into the blank books — Judges/Ruth/1-2 Samuel=Samuel, Kings=Jeremiah, Chronicles=Ezra, Job=Moses,
Esther=Mordecai (Hebrews metaV honestly marks "Unknown"). First as a LIVE read of `metav_writers`
(book_id 1-66 → abbrev via core `_KJV_BOOK_ID_REV`), then baked into the one list. Either way Haiku
WOULDN'T name those disputed authors — the summary SYSTEM prompt only names an author "when well
established", so it stayed silent (Job showed no writer). So we loosened `_AUTHOR_LINE_TMPL` to license
a "traditionally attributed to X" hedge — and it OVER-CORRECTED: Job's blurb then flatly said "Moses
wrote this book" and the chapter summary even narrated "Moses records, Job did not sin." Reverted the
hedge AND removed all the metaV gap-fills; the anonymous books are blank again.

Lessons worth keeping:
- **The name in the list is INERT — the prompt push is what broke it.** With normal wording Haiku
  just ignored Job=Moses and left the blurb blank; only the extra "traditionally attributed to X /
  don't omit the author" hedge forced it to assert. So a disputed name SITTING in the list is harmless;
  the danger is instructing Haiku to use it.
- **Don't hard-push Haiku on shaky facts.** It doesn't do "honest hedge" well — push it to name a
  disputed author and it asserts the claim outright (and leaks it into the chapter narration). Better
  to feed only well-established names and let Haiku stay silent on the rest.
- **DECIDED: don't re-add the metaV names.** Every gap-fill is a disputed/traditional attribution (the
  exact reason the curated list omitted them); none is "well established." Without the push Haiku would
  unpredictably assert some as fact. Curated list stays well-established-only + scribes. Don't re-try.
- **metaV doesn't fabricate, but it's confident about disputed traditions.** Honest "Unknown" for
  Hebrews, but flat Job→Moses, Esther→Mordecai, Kings→Jeremiah, etc. — fringe/Talmudic, not settled.
  Its data was also looser than ours in two spots (Psalms="David" vs our "David and other psalmists";
  John="John" vs "the apostle John"), so a blind total-swap would've been a downgrade.
- Not a cache/wiring bug — Jeremiah picking up Baruch immediately proved deploy + cache-refresh worked.
- `metav_writers` table exists (loaded by load_metav.py) but is NOT read anywhere now — dormant.
- Commits: 870db14 (live-read), bbf5148 (bake-in), 645c38f (hedge), c02ea0f (revert to scribes-only).
- OPEN, optional: 1 Peter "by Silvanus" (1Pe 5:12) as a scribe — debated (scribe vs carrier), left out.

## Study modules — admin Study tab + MetaV/Nave's import — BUILT 2026-06-12

Recovered a lost idea ("a DB that had study topics") → it was the **MetaV** dataset
(github.com/gusheng/MetaV, the same one People/Places/cross-refs came from), which carries
Nave's+Torrey's **Topics + TopicIndex**. Built an admin-only **Study** tab: sub-switch
**Topics · Denominations · Arguments**. Topics = a sectioned browse; denomination/argument = a
position→support→tension→resolution claim editor. Own `study.db` (gitignored, PA-only),
`views_study.py`, `static/src/55-study.jsx`. Loader `scripts/load_study_topics.py` imported
~1,819 concept topics + 696 person/place "name-topics". Full record: memory `project_study_modules`.

**Follow-on, all SHIPPED 2026-06-12/13:** the Nave's-sidebar tap-through; a real TWO-SIDED argument
layout (Side A | Side B + resolution, its own `sides` shape); a stepped reader WALKTHROUGH (built then
DROPPED for collapsible subtopics on the page — same cure, one view) + a BOOK sub-collapse inside big
subtopics; a "Preview as reader" admin toggle (all types now read-first); AI-drafted text-first Berean
topic INTROS (Haiku default / Sonnet for the public batch, sharpened prompt; ✦ button + bulk script);
title comma-flip for display + alphabetical list sort; and a publish/dupe-cleanup script set. Only the
public "go-live" flip (open published topics to visitors) is left.

Lessons worth keeping:
- **Topics are NOT claims.** First cut forced every topic into the support/tension/resolution
  shape; a plain topic is just "a subject + its verses," so that shape made no sense. Split into
  TWO shapes — sectioned topic browse vs the claim editor. Don't re-merge them.
- **Filter MetaV name-topics by NAME, not a verse-count proxy.** Nave's lists every proper name;
  those are already in the metaV sidebar + word search. Drop them using MetaV's own People/Places
  lists (short whitelist for God/Jesus/Holy Spirit); keep concepts. The verses-count "bandaid" was
  wrong — it kept big names and could drop small concepts.
- **MetaV's curated topics ≠ a concordance.** Subtopics ("Affliction — consolation under / made
  beneficial") are thematic and include verses without the keyword — real value over plain search.
  For bare names it IS just "where mentioned" (= search), hence dropping them.
- **CSV gotcha:** read MetaV CSVs as `utf-8-sig` — a BOM in the header made every verse link drop
  (the "0 verses" symptom). `--replace` clears prior `metav*` rows first so a re-run is clean.
- Verse text shown = **ABP prose** (the words' english joined like Prose mode), KJV per-verse fallback.
- **Walkthrough → collapse (06-13).** A stepped one-at-a-time reader was built first; on small topics it
  barely differed from the page, so it was dropped for collapsible subtopics (the cleaner fix). Don't re-add.
- **Nave's titles are index-style** ("Life, Eternal", "Devil"=Satan, "Accusation, False"). Match the
  curated `_COMMON` hot-list to the REAL titles (`find_topics.py`); flip them for DISPLAY only
  (`displayTitle`), don't rename the stored data. "X, the" = "The X" (mergeable dupe); "X, <aspect>" is a
  real subtopic (keep). Merge folds "X, the"→"X" with a dry-run + study.db backup + soft-delete.
- **Slow topic load was connection churn**, not the ABP word-stitching — `_resolve_body` opened a fresh
  db connection PER VERSE (~67 for a big topic). One shared connection fixed it (commit 25ad365).
- **Script API key:** the Anthropic key lives in the WSGI, not the shell — bulk scripts need
  `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` first or `core._anthropic` is None and they no-op.

## Focus mode + reader gesture/scroll fixes — DONE 2026-06-11

All on master, pushed. Full record: memory `project_focus_mode`.

- **Focus mode (distraction-free reading).** Tap blank space in the reader to strip the chrome; Esc or
  tap exits. NOT remembered across reloads. **Mobile** hides the chrome outright (header/nav/toolbar/tabs/
  audio — audio keeps playing). **Desktop** darkens everything with a click-through dark wash and floats
  the text as a `position:fixed`, centered, self-scrolling "book page" with big ‹ › page-turn arrows in
  the side gutters. Files: `90-app.jsx` (flag + shell class), `60-library.jsx` (trigger/page-turn/arrows),
  end of `styles.css`. Iterated live with the user: desktop went from hide-all → dark-spotlight; the page
  got centered on the whole screen (not the offset column), made tall with both edges, and the arrows
  moved to hug the page edges and grew to 76px. Open by-design: word-click lexicon shows dimmed behind
  the page in desktop focus.
- **Verse-number hit area tightened.** Digits moved to an inner `.lib-vnum-num` hit target; the `.lib-vnum`
  gutter is `user-select:none` + inert. Killed the "click/drag beside the number highlights the verse" bug.
- **Highlight pop-up = dismiss-only click** (matches the verse-number menu). First click closes it and is
  swallowed (no chip/verse/focus underneath). LESSON: the close re-renders before the click lands, so a
  state-in-closure check read stale — fixed with a `swallowClickRef` set at mouse-DOWN, checked AFTER the
  `justSelectedRef` (selection-ending) check. Two passes to get right.
- **Pericope headings left-aligned on both** mobile + desktop (were centered on mobile); mobile keeps the
  hidden verse-gutter width so the heading lines up with the verse text.
- **Jump-to-verse scroll:** reader lands the verse in the UPPER THIRD (not centered); left nav scrolls the
  active book to the TOP of its own `.nav-scroll` list, never the window (which used to push the verse
  off-screen). Decided per-case: reader = upper-third, nav = top.

## NIV text + multi-text Compare + reader UI tweaks — DONE 2026-06-10

All on master, deployed. Detail: memory `project_esv_audio` (NIV) + `project_pericopes_parallel` (Compare).

- **NIV — 2nd owner-only text, mirrors ESV exactly.** `views_niv.py`, own `niv.db` (gitignored, PA-only),
  `core.niv_db`, NIV toggle next to ESV. TEXT-ONLY — checked FCBH and it doesn't carry NIV audio (commercially
  licensed), so no audio route. Source = aruljohn/Bible-niv (66 JSON files, `book/chapters/verses`); loaded by
  `scripts/load_niv.py ~/Bible-niv ~/bible-db/niv.db` (maps book name → 1-66 id, ~31,104 verses). The loader
  fixes the source's backtick-for-apostrophe quirk (`God`s` → `God's`); validated the format against the real
  repo before loading. No WSGI change — the existing `OWNER_EMAIL` gate covers it.
- **"Parallel" → multi-text COMPARE (pick 2–4).** Choose any 2–4 of ABP/KJV/BSB/ESV/NIV side by side.
  Desktop = N columns (`.lib-cmp-2/3/4`); mobile = stacked, one labeled line per text (user picked
  "stack per verse" over side-scroll). `compareSel` array holds the picks; per-text loaders fire when their
  id is selected; render = ordered UNION of verse keys (chapter+verse) so a missing verse leaves a blank cell.
  BSB/ESV/NIV inherit the Psalm alignment for free (all English = MT numbering). Notes/highlights SHARED across
  columns (plain columns got the anchor + whole-verse highlight paint + note dot; ABP/KJV inherit theirs).
  LESSON: in compare the home-text exact-WORD highlight paint rounds up to whole-verse (translation is
  "parallel", matches no note's home text) — left as-is on purpose (reads clean in narrow columns).
- **Reader UI tweaks (same session):** mobile note/journal/copy bar is icon-only (reused the existing
  `note-btn-lbl` span that CSS already hides on mobile; desktop keeps the text); mobile prose verse number
  kept `inline` instead of `inline-block` — that was the cause of the number dangling at a line end (an
  inline-block creates a wrap point after it; inline doesn't). Book selector left as-is (the translation
  buttons live in the left nav, not the toolbar, so columns don't crowd it).

---

## ESV (owner-only) + read-along audio + visitor stats — DONE 2026-06-10

A big session. All on master, deployed. Full detail: memory `project_esv_audio` + `project_visitor_stats`.

- **ESV reading text — owner-only, server-gated, LIVE.** Crossway-copyright → not public. Gated to the
  owner's notes.db login on the SERVER (404 to everyone else, not just a hidden toggle). Own `esv.db`
  (gitignored, PA-only), loaded by `scripts/load_esv.py` from github.com/lguenth/mdbible (`by_book/NN_Name.md`;
  31,104 verses). `views_esv.py`. Reads like BSB (plain, proseLocked).
- **Read-along audio.** BSB is LIVE for everyone — public-domain openbible.com Souer mp3s (no key, no
  self-host). ESV audio built (FCBH Bible Brain, NT-only fileset) but waits on `FCBH_API_KEY`. Shared
  `core._USFM_BOOK` + `usfm_titlecase()` (FCBH wants UPPERCASE, openbible title-case).
- **Player evolved through several user passes** (lessons): custom player with skip buttons → then
  "Listen button = play/pause + just a bar" → then moved into the TOOLBAR (icon) → chrono got inline
  per-chapter controls, which were CLUNKY on mobile and got REVERTED to one scroll-aware toolbar button
  (plays the chapter at ~45% mid-screen; bar inline only at the playing chapter in chrono). KEY BUG FIX:
  the play/pause icon must reflect ONLY whether audio is playing (`showPause = audioPlaying`) — tying it
  to the in-view chapter made it flip on scroll ("doesn't catch up").
- **KJV/BSB/ESV now read as continuous PROSE** (`renderFlowVerse`, `.lib-prose-flow`) like ABP — they used
  to render one block per verse everywhere (most obvious in chrono). Word/chip + parallel modes unchanged.
- **Visitor stats — owner-only, in-house.** Tried GoatCounter (one script tag) then REMOVED it for a
  private counter in `notes.db` (`visits` table; daily IP+UA hash, referrer, no cookies/IPs, owner's own
  visits skipped). `views_stats.py`; About → **About|Stats toggle** (not a separate tab; `85-stats.jsx`).
- **One shared site-owner gate:** `views_notes.is_owner()` (`OWNER_EMAIL`, falls back to `ESV_OWNER_EMAIL`)
  — set ONE env var to gate both ESV + Stats. views_esv dropped its local copy. GOTCHA confirmed again:
  the env line must sit ABOVE the app import in the WSGI + reload (module-level read at import).
- Smaller wins: tab remembered across refresh (`localStorage` `lexica.view.v1`); distinct verse-marker
  icons (bookmark ribbon vs note/highlight pencil); desktop chapter label dropped from the toolbar;
  source picker compacted so the owner's 5th button (ESV) fits; verse-menu Note icon-only on mobile;
  all scrollable popouts got `overscroll-behavior: contain` so they don't bleed-scroll the reader.

## Words-table rebuild → one self-correcting pass (refactor backlog #2) — DONE 2026-06-09

The rebuild used to be: wipe the word table, rebuild from source, then run a long chain of ~14 patch
scripts in an exact order to fix it back up — the riskiest job in the repo. Now the build fixes
itself. The six shape-keyed, re-runnable cleanup steps run INSIDE the build, per verse
(bracket_punct, g1473_gloss, lord_subject, funcword_subject, lord_oath, greek_pos backfill), in the
same order the old chain used. Only the genuine per-verse patches that a blanket rule would break
stay behind, run by one tail script (`scripts/finish_rebuild.sh`) plus a final punctuation pass.

- **Proven, not hoped.** Built it BOTH ways on a copy of the live database — old way (build + all 14
  patches) and new way (the one self-correcting pass) — and compared every word: **byte-identical**
  (same 624,575 rows, same fingerprint). Tools: `scripts/compare_words.py` (whole-table compare),
  `tests/test_folded_fixes.py` (now in CI + the commit hook).
- **Validated locally first**, on copies in a folder OUTSIDE the repo (`C:\Users\JP\lexica-val`:
  bible.db + bh_scrape.db + the Rahlfs/TAGNT alignment files). The live database was never touched.
  Committed `815c1c6`, pushed, CI green, deployed to PA.
- **Bonus, the one place the new build beats the old chain:** the final punctuation pass also tidies
  ~202 spots where a comma sat on the verb instead of the last word shown in the LORD-subject
  brackets ("said · the LORD,").
- **Kept as small pinned patches (can't fold):** split_merges (237 — a general splitter rule
  regresses ~85 other verses), subject_reorder / mat25_37 / supplied_attach (hand-listed reorder
  verses), theos_filler_tags + kyrios_mistags (a few SOURCE mis-tags you can't rebuild away — e.g.
  Greek "Cyrus" looks like "of the lord"), merge_misses. ~270 verses out of 31,000 — small and stable.
- vs the LIVE database there were 17,498 differences, ALL pre-existing drift (older head-word
  handling + a newer proper-noun list + 3 Cyrus fixes live never got) — none from the fold; the
  old-way rebuild showed the same drift. The standalone fix_*.py scripts are KEPT as re-appliers; on
  a fresh build they find 0 to do.

**THE STANDING LEVER — CHECKED 2026-06-09, DECLINED (keep the patch).** The word-splitter GUESSES
which English word goes with which Greek word by matching the dictionary — that leaky guess is what the
237-verse `fix_split_merges` patch cleans up. The idea was to feed the real word-by-word alignment data
(the Rahlfs/TAGNT files from the pronoun fix) into the splitter (`_split_compounds`) to replace the
guess and retire the patch. A read-only check on the lexica-val copy killed it: that data is Greek-only
— it tells you each Greek word's grammar but never which English word pairs with it, so it can't do the
English-to-Greek matching that IS the splitter's job. It can only act as a grammar filter afterward, and
the filter can't tell a good split from a bad one: allowing only plain nouns/verbs would wrongly throw
away 126 of the 240 good fixes (53% — the good splits land on little words like "and"/"me"/"not" all the
time), and the grammar tag is missing on a fifth of all words. The one clean signal — "never pile a real
word onto 'the'" — covers under half the garbles and the build already guards it. So the frozen
237-verse patch stays: small, stable, proven. **LESSON:** an alignment with no English in it can't
replace an English-pairing step; it can only filter, and a filter can't reconstruct the missing pairing.
Throwaway check scripts: `C:\Users\JP\lexica-val\check_splitter_morph.py` + `check_237_targets_morph.py`.
See memory `project_architecture_rework` (#2) and `project_parser_number_reversal`. DON'T re-investigate.

## BSB (Berean Standard Bible) reading text — DONE 2026-06-08

Public-domain modern reading text alongside ABP/KJV. Loaded by `scripts/load_bsb.py` into
`bsb_verses`, served by `views_bsb.py` (`/api/bsb/chapter`); third option in the Library toggle
(commit `4c88501`). Also added an eSword-style in-text search box that searches whichever text you're
reading, via the generic `/api/text-search` (commit `05fe6d5`). No word-level/Strong's data by design.

---

## Free-form Journal — second note mode — DONE 2026-06-09

"Verse notes | Journal" toggle in the Notes tab: plain-text titled pages, a full-page autosaving
editor, riding the same store / sync / Export-Import as anchored notes (`kind:"journal"`, no anchor).
Plus copy + "send verse to journal" from the reader (drag-select bar AND the verse-number menu) into
the page you have open. Detail in memory `project_notes_highlights`.

---

## Front-end "build a word entry" de-dup (refactor backlog #3, front-end half) — DONE 2026-06-08

The three copy-pasted entry-builders now share one core (`entrySnum()` + `wordEntryCore()` in
static/src/00-core.jsx); makeEntry / flattenAiResults / the library makeEntry each spread the core
and add only their own id + extras. No behavior change. Commit `007446c`. Closes the front-end half
of refactor backlog #3 (the backend half was redesign Phase 2).

---

## Notes accounts + sync (email + Google) — DONE 2026-06-09

Built right after the notes feature, same session. Notes started browser-only; the user weighed a
"sync code" (decided too clunky to copy around) and went with real **email + password accounts**,
then added **Google sign-in** too. Because the notes were already stored in the migration-ready
shape (each note has its own id from creation), turning on accounts was a straight copy — nothing
from the browser-only build was wasted.

- It's the **first time the site stores anything a visitor creates** — everything before was
  read-only/no-login. User data lives in its OWN file, `notes.db`, kept separate from the Bible
  database so a corpus rebuild can't touch it.
- Accounts are **opt-in**: the app stays fully usable with no login (notes just stay on that one
  browser). Sign in and your notes follow you to any device.
- Passwords are stored scrambled one-way (never readable). Staying logged in uses a random token,
  not the password. Sync merges by each note's id, newest edit wins; deletes leave a marker so they
  spread instead of coming back.
- Google sign-in is wired so the button only appears once it's fully set up — a half-finished deploy
  can't break the site.
- **Not done:** "forgot password" / set-a-password — that needs the site to send email, which isn't
  set up on PythonAnywhere yet. So a Google-only account has no password to fall back on for now.

Lessons that cost time (in memory `project_notes_highlights`): the site's secrets/keys live in the
**WSGI file** (`os.environ[...]`), not a `.env` — the `.env` on PA was empty and ignored, so the
Google ID had to go in the WSGI file, above the app import, then reload. Diagnose a missing Google
button with `curl <site>/api/auth/config`. And `google-auth` needs a `pip install` in the venv after
pulling (it's in requirements.txt).

---

## Notes & highlights (study notes) — DONE 2026-06-09

Readers can now write study notes and paint color highlights right in the Library, and find them
again later. Built and shipped in one session as small POCs, tweaked live against the user's testing.

- **Where they're kept:** the browser only (`localStorage`) — no database, no login, nothing on
  PythonAnywhere. Decided browser-first on purpose: the saved shape is exactly what a future
  account/sync would use, so moving notes "up to the cloud" later is a straight copy, not a rewrite.
  Each note gets its own id the moment it's created, so merging two devices later won't duplicate.
- **How you make one:** drag-select words → a little bar with 5 highlight colors + a "Note" button;
  or right-click a verse number (long-press on phones) for a whole-verse note. These don't fight the
  existing clicks — a word still opens the lexicon, a verse number still opens cross-references.
- **A note and a highlight are the same thing** — one record that can have text, a color, or both.
- **Finding them:** a new Notes tab lists everything with text search, plus Export (downloads a
  backup file) and Import (merges one back in, safe to re-run). A bookmark shows in the margin of
  any verse that has one.

Lessons / why certain choices: chip mode has no spaces between words, so the saved quote had to be
rebuilt from the chips (not the raw selection). On mobile the browser's own copy/share toolbar fights
a popup near the selection, so the "Add note" bar is pinned to the screen bottom there. The margin
marker had to live *inside* the verse text (indent the first line only) or it shoved every wrapped
line over. Highlights paint only in the text they were made in (ABP word-for-word; KJV/BSB whole
verse) — true cross-translation paint is a known follow-up. Open follow-ups are listed in TODO.md;
full detail in memory `project_notes_highlights`.

## AI result cache — unified prompt-fingerprint scheme — DONE 2026-06-09

The four Haiku-backed caches (AI search, reading summaries, TSK cross-refs, person/place blurbs) all
live in the one `ai_search_cache` table but each versioned itself differently: search hashed its own
prompt (good — edit the prompt, the cache auto-refreshes), but summaries used a hand-bumped number you
had to remember to change, and the cross-ref + person/place caches never refreshed on a prompt edit at
all. Fixed: every cache now tags its rows `category:hash-of-its-own-prompt`. Edit any prompt and only
that cache refreshes, lazily, with no manual bump.

- One shared set of helpers in `core.py` (`ai_fingerprint`, `ai_cache_get/put`, `ai_cache_prune`,
  plus a one-time `ai_cache_drop_legacy` sweep). Each cache prunes only its OWN stale rows at startup.
- **The landmine, handled:** search's old startup cleanup deleted every other cache's rows except the
  ones it spared by name. Switching the other caches to the new tag would have made that delete wipe
  them. It's now scoped to search's own rows only. Proven with a focused test (search prune leaves the
  others untouched, and each cache prunes only its own).
- **Per-book authors (the user's call):** a summary's row key stays stable, the author goes only in the
  tag — so editing one book's author refreshes just that book, while editing the prompt wording refreshes
  all summaries.
- LSJ was deliberately left out — it stores its summaries in the lexicon tables, not this cache table.
- One-time cost: the first run after deploy clears the old-format rows, so everything cached before
  regenerates once on next view. Unavoidable when changing the tagging scheme.
- Verified locally without touching the real database: logic test on a throwaway copy + a full app boot
  against a copy of the database (startup cleanup ran clean). Closes refactor backlog #4's cache half;
  the paired prompt-STYLE cleanup is still open in TODO.md.
  `code: core.py helpers, ai.py ~741-805, views_summary.py, views_crossref.py, views_metav.py, app.py startup`

## Word click-targets ("dual-ordering") — mostly done

The goal: when one slot bundled several English words, give each its own clickable chip while
keeping both the Greek order (chip view) and the English reading order (prose view) correct.
Again — never a reading bug, just click precision. The mechanism is proven and the bulk shipped:

- **"the LORD" + verb** — split so "the LORD" is its own chip. 795 spots fixed, live 2026-06-05.
  Rollback: `bible_pre_lordsubj_20260605.db`. `script: fix_lord_subject.py`
- **Nouns stuck on a function word** — moved the noun's English back onto its own empty slot.
  Done in three rounds (everyday nouns, then idioms, then plurals/in-bracket cases), 108 fixes
  total, live 2026-06-06. Rollbacks: `bible_pre_funcword_20260606.db`,
  `bible_pre_funcword_idioms_20260606.db`. `script: fix_funcword_subject.py`
- **Scrapped:** a third case (a verb's English wrapping around its subject) — too few, too varied,
  and would need risky row inserts for tiny payoff. Parked for good.
- **ἴδιος "own"** — 'his/their/its own' (ὁ G3588 + ἴδιος G2398) parked on the article slot with ἴδιος
  empty beside it. Same relocate move as the noun fix, but the orphan is the ADJECTIVE ἴδιος, so the
  folded noun pass skipped it. 13 spots (1Co/1Ti/2Ti/2Pe/Heb), live 2026-06-14. Rollback:
  `bible_pre_idios_20260614.db`. `script: fix_idios_own.py` (+ `dump_verse_words.py`, read-only inspector).

The "the"/article cleanup is now essentially CLOSED (see live TODO): a 2026-06-14 read-only
`audit_funcword_wrongslot.py` re-measure showed the NOUN-behind-"the" case at **0** (the folded
`funcword_subject` already handles it — the old "highest-volume remaining" framing was stale), the
ἴδιος "own" subset is fixed (above), and the ~25 remaining gray-zone cases (midst/least/whole/indeed,
some defensible Greek) are left on purpose. The proven method if anyone resumes a similar cleanup:
always start read-only and measure first; copy the database before any real change; never run a
blanket delete; keep repair scripts narrow, re-runnable, with a dry-run; and add them to the
checklist in CLAUDE.md.

---

## Non-canonical library — built and live (2026-06-07)

A whole shelf of extra texts now lives in the Library under the "Other" menu, walled off from Bible
search and word counts (ABP stays the anchor). All English-only unless noted:
- **Septuagint Apocrypha** (16 books, Brenton 1851).
- **Pseudepigrapha** — 1-2 Enoch, Jubilees, 2-3 Baruch, Apocalypse of Abraham, Assumption of Moses,
  2 Esdras/4 Ezra, Life of Adam and Eve, Psalms of Solomon, Letter of Aristeas, Ascension of Isaiah,
  Sibylline Oracles (mostly R.H. Charles; sources per-book in memory).
- **Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs** (12 separate books, Charles).
- **Apostolic Fathers** (14, incl. Didache) — these have the **full Greek interlinear**, same
  word-study layer as the Bible: Brannan/Lake Greek → Strong's (openscriptures + Dodson glosses) →
  Lightfoot English. Polycarp ch 10-14 survive only in Latin → English-only there.

How it's built (generic, re-runnable): each text gets its own two tables `<book>_words` /
`<book>_verses`, served by `/api/extra/<book>/chapter/<n>`, loaded by `scripts/load_extra.py`. Adding
a future text = tag it, drop two json files, add one line to `NONCANON`, load. `englishOnly:true`
locks the reader to Prose for texts with no original-language tagging. The full pipeline, source URLs,
and per-book parsing quirks are in memory `project_noncanonical_texts`. Still open (in the live TODO):
more books (Jasher, 4 Baruch…), optional hand-written headings, wiring these into the Lexicon/Search
tabs, and the Hebrew-interlinear gap.

---

## Search results now match the Library look — done

The AI search result verses were restyled to match the polished Library reading view: plain word
chips in reading order, no Strong's clutter, brackets kept, gold highlights kept (same as Library's
chip mode). Also stopped re-fetching each verse's words one at a time — the search response now
carries the words the server already built. `code: Search results in static/src/70-search.jsx`

---

## Lexicon tab — finished (ongoing polish only)

The word-study flow (search → word profile → gloss chips → book distribution → verse list) is done
and reads cleanly, matched to the Library look. Anything left is minor spacing/hierarchy polish done
as noticed — nothing structural. `code: LexiconView in static/src/80-lexicon.jsx`

---

## Full corpus audit — done, corpus is sound (2026-06-05)

Checked all ~624k words against independent reference texts. **Verdict: the corpus is sound.**
- Internal consistency check: zero of the pronoun-class corruption that bit us before.
- External agreement: ~92% match against the reference Greek texts. The other 8% is *not* error —
  it's genuine edition/translation differences and proper-noun number quirks. **100% is the wrong
  target** (it would mean rewriting our text into theirs) — don't chase it.
- One real issue found and fixed: 1,724 pronoun slots labeled with the wrong person, corrected.
  Rollback: `bible_pre_g1473gloss_20260605.db`. `script: fix_g1473_gloss.py`
- A residual ~1,069 cases are blocked on missing grammar data — not chased, not worth guessing.
- Audit scripts are read-only and in the rebuild checklist. `scripts: audit_corpus_tier1/2.py`

---

## Word-order garble fixes — done (2026-06-05)

A rebuild had left some multi-word phrases reading backwards or bundled wrong.
- **"this/that of X" over-reach** — fixed; 3,438 verses corrected. Rollback:
  `bible_pre_splitfix_20260604.db`.
- **Bracketed phrases reading scrambled** — fixed; 374 → 0. (Memory: project_bracket_order_fix.)
- **Hab 3:14 showed up twice** — root cause was a duplicated line in the source text file; removed
  at source and cleaned the live database. `script: fix_hab314_dupes.py`
- **Punctuation on the wrong word** — fixed (365 verses). `script: fix_bracket_punct.py`
- Known harmless false alarms in the old audit tools (~8 twin-bracket flags) — database is correct,
  **don't re-chase them.**

---

## Lexicon coverage for pronouns — done (2026-06-04)

Made sure pronoun forms (this/that/who/me/you in all their endings) resolve to a real dictionary
entry instead of a terse fallback. Found the big paradigms already resolve fine; added a handful of
small redirect stubs for the few genuine gaps. Rollback for the stubs is a one-line delete (in the
memory note). Reopen only if a specific word is reported showing the terse gloss.

---

## Text structure — done

- **Section headings** added across the whole canon (2,431 of them), shown in chip/prose/parallel.
  (Song of Solomon has none — the source doesn't carry them; not a bug.)
- **Prose reading mode** — normal books flow as paragraphs with small verse numbers; poetry keeps
  one line per verse.
- **Font size control** — A−/A+ buttons, remembered in the browser.

---

## Reader typeface picker — TRIED + REVERTED (2026-06-11)

Built a "Reading font" picker (Source Serif default · Cardo · Gentium) in the text-style menu, then
**pulled it the same day** (commits 8a9a635/6a08858 in, f1f96a5 out). **Why it failed:** the reader
was already on Source Serif 4 — a good serif — so this was a preference toggle, not an upgrade. The
two alternatives both looked worse on the user's Windows display (Cardo renders thin/rough; Gentium
also disliked). Replacement candidates (Literata, EB Garamond, Noto Serif) didn't win either, so the
user scrapped the whole picker rather than keep weaker fonts. **Lesson: don't re-add a serif picker —
Source Serif is the keeper.** What DID work and is worth remembering if this ever comes back: scope a
font swap to the reader by overriding `--f-serif`/`--f-greek` inline on `.lib-reading` (custom props
inherit, so the rest of the app is untouched); Google fonts lazy-load (the binary downloads only when
a glyph renders); and Cardo/Gentium need a Hebrew fallback (Frank Ruhl Libre) since they carry no
Hebrew — that fallback DID render cleanly (no boxes). Memory `project_reader_appearance`.

---

## Pronoun number fix + grammar display — done (2026-06-04)

Live as rebuild #6. Rollback: `bible_pre_morph_20260604.db`. (Memory: project_pronoun_fix_path_c.)
- Added word-grammar data (part of speech, tense, case…) covering ~78% of words.
- Fixed "he is a prophet" word order (Gen 20:7) and a couple of related ordering cases.
- Word grammar now shows in plain English in the word pop-up for ABP Greek (e.g. "Verb · Aorist ·
  Active · Indicative · 3rd person · Singular").

---

## MetaV (people & places) — done

- People sidebar (bio, family, genealogy) and places sidebar (map + coordinates), with proper-noun
  clicks routed correctly in both ABP and KJV.
- Hebrew names route to the people/places view with the Hebrew dictionary stacked below; clans
  (the "-ites") are labeled "People / Clan". When a name has no data, a short AI blurb fills in
  (text-first, cached).
