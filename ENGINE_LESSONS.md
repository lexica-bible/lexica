# ENGINE_LESSONS.md — what the definition engine v2 should do differently

Design-level lessons only. This file is NOT:
- `AUDIT_lexica_rollout.md` (WHAT happened, per word — the authority on saga detail), or
- the standing rules in `CLAUDE.md` / memory (HOW we operate the current engine).

It is the **v2 design backlog**: one line per lesson, each pointing to its audit-doc entry for the
evidence. It grows by HABIT — add a line the moment a design-level finding is logged, don't batch.
Nothing here is scheduled work; it's the "if we rebuild the engine, change these" list.

## Lessons (this batch, 2026-07-06/07)

1. **Truth-gates converge, style-gates fish.** Holes/merges/completeness settle in 1–few draws; "match
   the sense count" and other style properties never settle. → v2 steers STYLE at the prompt layer
   (formatting block), and GATES only truth properties. *(audit: SHIP BAR re-ruled / three-regimes finding
   / STYLE WATCH #1–#3)*

2. **Fabrication was stimulus-driven, not prompt-driven.** The "Heaven" capitalization fabrication survived
   two prompt generations (V4, V5) and died the instant the case-split was removed from the fed evidence.
   → v2: AUDIT THE FED EVIDENCE before tuning prompts; a stimulus you can delete beats a prompt line that
   steers around it. *(audit: GLOSS-SET CASE-FOLD / οὐρανός three-attempt saga)*

3. **Ship draws sample off the reviewer's modal carve.** ὕδωρ: the target shape was ~70% of reviewer draws,
   yet the ship path missed it twice before hitting on attempt 3. → v2 candidate: ship-path DRAW-UNTIL-MATCH
   against the banked reviewer verdict, natively (not a manual redraw loop). *(audit: G5204 ὕδωρ)*

4. **Substitution blind spot.** A headword standing in for another referent is invisible to reviewer, gates,
   AND collocation flags UNLESS a signature collocate exists (βασιλεία caught "kingdom of heaven"; bare
   "sinned against heaven", Luk 15:18-class, is uncovered). → v2 wants a substitution probe for the
   no-collocate case. *(audit: APPARATUS FINDINGS — blind-spot refined)*

5. **Usage-dimensionality, not referent-concreteness, predicts wobble.** A concrete referent can wobble
   (καρδία, ὕδωρ) if its USES are multi-facet; a word wobbles by how many shallow analytical cuts its usage
   offers. → v2 could pre-classify words by usage-dimensionality and scale reviewer-floor depth accordingly
   (ties to lesson 8). *(audit: Framing correction / G5204 hypothesis result)*

6. **Reuse rule, both directions.** A private copy of the sense-splitter broke the reviewer (per_sense used
   its own bold-only regex); single-source `gloss_set` made the case-fold a one-place atomic fix. → v2 has
   ONE splitter, ONE gloss_set — no second copies of scan/transform logic, ever. *(audit: REVIEWER PARSER
   DRIFT FIX + SECOND PARSER FIX + GLOSS-SET CASE-FOLD)*

7. **Gloss_notes make unverified factual claims about the corpus.** The citation gate checks REFERENCES, not
   ASSERTIONS (capitalization practice, translation behavior). → v2 wants a position/text verification step
   for corpus-practice claims — mechanizable for the capitalization case (verse text is in the DB,
   sentence-initial is testable). *(audit: APPARATUS FINDINGS — unverifiable-assertion defect class)*

8. **Fixed fed-40 under-samples SYSTEMATICALLY on high-occurrence / multi-domain words** (μέγας's dense
   Levitical collocations, οὐρανός's metonym verses unfed entirely, ὕδωρ's purity/river/sea neighbors), and
   presumably wastes sample on redundancy for flat-usage words. → v2 candidate: dynamic fed-count scaled by
   occurrence count and/or usage-dimensionality (lesson 5), possibly collocation-aware sampling that reserves
   slots for high-PMI neighbor contexts so signature uses can't be unfed by chance. **Evidence: every
   collocation flag this batch was a fed-sampling miss — zero were missing senses.** The current design
   survives its under-sampling only because the eyeball-and-resolve step catches it; v2 turns that manual
   resolution into sampling policy. *(audit: fed-40 retro thread + μέγας/G39/οὐρανός/ὕδωρ flag entries)*

## Carried from v1 (foundational — proven, keep as v2 invariants)

9. **The deterministic/model boundary holds where it's tested.** Every correctness fix that worked is
   DETERMINISTIC (book table, chapter-strip, soft set, case-fold, exact lookup); everything model-side stays
   ADVISORY. → v2 keeps correctness gates deterministic and the model's output advisory-until-gated. *(audit:
   Batch-One process lesson 3)*

10. **Review-what-ships: reviewed prose must be byte-identical to shipped prose.** The draw cache made this
    an invariant (apply reads the reviewed bytes, no fresh model call). → v2 keeps the reviewed artifact and
    the shipped artifact the same object. *(audit: Batch-two prep #1 — draw cache)*
